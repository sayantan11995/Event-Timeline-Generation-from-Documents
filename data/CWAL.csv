Sept. 3. 1848,You may possibly remember seeing me at the Philadelphia Convention introduced to you as the lone whig star of Illinois,1,event,0
Sept. 3. 1848," Since the adjournment, I have remained here, so long, in the Whig document room",0,,
Sept. 3. 1848," I am now about to start for home  and I desire the undisguised opinion of some experienced and sagacious Pennsylvania politician, as to how the vote of that state, for governor, and president, is likely to go",1,demand,1
Sept. 3. 1848," In casting about for such a man, I have settled upon you  and I shall be much obliged if you will write me at Springfield, Illinois",1,event,1
Sept. 3. 1848,"
 The news we are receiving here now, by letters from all quarters is steadily on the rise  we have none lately of a discouraging character",1,event,1
Sept. 3. 1848," This is the sum, without giving particulars",0,,
"September 12, 1848"," Abram Lincoln, whig member of Congress from Illinois, a representative of free soil",1,fact,2
"September 12, 1848"," Lincoln has a very tall and thin figure, with an intellectual face, showing a searching mind, and a cool judgment",1,fact,3
"September 12, 1848"," He spoke in a clear and cool, and very eloquent manner, for an hour and a half,Page 2
 carrying the audience with him in his able arguments and brilliant illustrations only interrupted by warm and frequent applause",1,event,4
"September 12, 1848"," He began by expressing a real feeling of modesty in addressing an audience  this side of the mountains,  a part of the country where, in the opinion of the people of his section, everybody was supposed to be instructed and wise",1,event,5
"September 12, 1848"," But he had devoted his attention to the question of the coming Presidential election, and was not unwilling to exchange with all whom he might meet the ideas to which he had arrived",1,event,5
"September 12, 1848", He then began to show the fallacy of some of the arguments against Gen,1,event,5
"September 12, 1848"," Taylor, making his chief theme the fashionable statement of all those who oppose him,  the old Locofocos as well as the new  that he has no principles, and that the whig party have abandoned their principles by adopting him as their candidate",1,event,5
"September 12, 1848"," Taylor occupied a high and unexceptionable whig ground, and took for his first instance and proof of this his statement in the Allison letter  3 with regard to the Bank, Tariff, Rivers and Harbors,  c",1,event,5
"September 12, 1848"," that the will of the people should produce its own results, without Executive influence",0,,
"September 12, 1848"," The principle that the people should do what under the constitution they please, is a whig principle",0,,
"September 12, 1848"," Taylor does is not only to consent, but to appeal to the people to judge and act for themselves",1,fact,6
"September 12, 1848", And this was no new doctrine for Whigs,0,,
"September 12, 1848"," It was the  platform  on which they had fought all their battles, the resistance of Executive influence, and the principle of enabling the people to frame the government according to their will",1,event,6
"September 12, 1848"," Taylor consents to be the candidate, and to assist the people to do what they think to be their duty, and think to be best in their natural affairs, but because he don t want to tell what we ought to do, he is accused of having no principles",1,event,6
"September 12, 1848"," The Whigs here  have  maintained for years that neither the influence, the duress, or the prohibition of the Executive should control the legitimately expressed will of the people  and now that on that very ground, Gen",1,fact,6
"September 12, 1848"," Taylor says that he should use the power given him by the people to do, to the best of his
 judgment, the will of the people, he is accused of want of principle, and of inconsistency in position",1,demand,6
"September 12, 1848"," Lincoln proceeded to examine the absurdity of an attempt to make a platform or creed for a national party, to all parts of which all must consent and agree, when it was clearly the intentionPage 3
 and the true philosophy of our government, that in Congress all opinions and principles should be represented, and that when the wisdom of all had been compared and united, the will of the majority should be carried out",1,event,6
"September 12, 1848"," On this ground he conceived  and the audience seemed to go with him  that General Taylor held correct, sound republican principles",1,event,6
"September 12, 1848"," Lincoln then passed to the subject of slavery in the States, saying that the people of Illinois agreed entirely with the people of Massachusetts on this subject, except perhaps that they did not keep so constantly thinking about it",1,event,6
"September 12, 1848"," All agreed that slavery was an evil, but that we were not responsible for it and cannot affect it in States of this Union where we do not live",1,fact,6
"September 12, 1848"," But, the question of the extension of slavery to new territories of this country, is a part of our responsibility and care, and is
 under our control",1,fact,
"September 12, 1848"," believed that the self named  Free Soil  party, was far behind the Whigs",1,fact,6
"September 12, 1848", Both parties opposed the extension,0,,
"September 12, 1848", As he understood it the new party had no principle except this opposition,1,fact,7
"September 12, 1848"," If their platform held any other, it was in such a general way that it was like the pair of pantaloons the Yankee pedler offered for sale,  large enough for any man, small enough for any boy",1,fact,7
"September 12, 1848",  They therefore had taken a position calculated to break down their single important declared object,1,event,8
"September 12, 1848", They were working for the election of either Gen,0,,
"September 12, 1848", Cass or Gen,0,,
"September 12, 1848", Taylor,0,,
"September 12, 1848","
 The Speaker then went on to show, clearly and eloquently, the danger of extension of slavery, likely to result from the election of General Cass",1,event,8
"September 12, 1848", To unite with those who annexed the new territory to prevent the extension of slavery in that territory seemed to him to be in the highest degree absurd and ridiculous,1,event,9
"September 12, 1848", Suppose these gentlemen succeed in electing Mr,0,,
"September 12, 1848"," Van Buren, they had no specific means to prevent the extension of slavery to New Mexico and California, and Gen",1,fact,10
"September 12, 1848"," Taylor, he confidently believed, would not encourage it, and would not prohibit its restriction",1,event,10
"September 12, 1848", But if Gen,0,,
"September 12, 1848"," Cass was elected, he felt certain that the plans of farther extension of territory would be encouraged, and those of the extension of slavery would meet no check",1,event,11
"September 12, 1848","
 The  Free Soil  men in claiming that name indirectly attempted a deception, by implying the Whigs were not Free Soil men",1,fact,12
"September 12, 1848"," In declaring that they would  do their duty and leave the consequences to God,  merely gave an excuse for taking a course that they were not able to maintain by a fair and full argument",1,demand,12
"September 12, 1848", To make this declaration did not show what their duty was,0,,
"September 12, 1848"," If it did we should have no use for judgment, we might as well be made without intellect, and when divine or human law does not clearly point out whatPage 4is our duty, we have no means of finding out what it is by using our most intelligent judgment of the consequences",1,demand,13
"September 12, 1848"," If there were divine law, or human law for voting for Martin Van Buren, or if a fair examination of the consequences and first reasoning would show that voting for him would bring about the ends they pretended to wish then he would give up the argument",1,demand,14
"September 12, 1848"," But since there was no fixed law on the subject, and since the whole probable result of their action would be an assistance in electing Gen",1,fact,14
"September 12, 1848"," CASS, he must say that they were behind the Whigs in their advocacy of the freedom of the soil",1,demand,14
"September 12, 1848","
 Mr",0,,
"September 12, 1848"," Lincoln proceeded to rally the Buffalo Convention  4  for forbearing to say anything after all the previous declarations of those members who were formerly Whigs on the subject of the Mexican war, because the Van Burens had been known to have supported it",1,event,15
"September 12, 1848"," He declared that of all the parties asking the confidence of the country, this new one had less of principle than any other",1,event,16
"September 12, 1848","
 He wondered whether it was still the opinion of these Free Soil gentlemen, as declared in the  whereas  at Buffalo, that the whig and democratic parties were both entirely dissolved and absorbed into their own body",1,event,16
"September 12, 1848"," Had the Vermont election given them any light  They had calculated on making as great an impression in that State as in any part of the Union, and there their attempts had been wholly ineffectual",1,event,16
"September 12, 1848", Their failure there was a greater success than they would find in any other part of the Union,1,fact,16
"September 12, 1848","
 Mr",0,,
"September 12, 1848"," Lincoln went on to say that he honestly believed that all those who wished to keep up the character of the Union  who did not believe in enlarging our field, but in keeping our fences where they are and cultivating our present possession, making it a garden, improving the morals and education of the people  devoting the administration to this purpose  all real Whigs, friends of good honest government the race was ours",1,event,17
"September 12, 1848"," He had opportunities of hearing from almost every part of the Union from reliable sources, and had not heard of a country  county  in which he had not received accessions from other parties",1,event,17
"September 12, 1848"," If the true Whigs come forward and join these new friends, they need not have a doubt",1,demand,18
"September 12, 1848"," We had a candidate whose personal character and principles he had already described, whom he could not eulogize if he would",1,event,19
"September 12, 1848", Gen,0,,
"September 12, 1848"," Taylor had been constantly, perseveringly, quietly standing up, doing his duty, and asking no praise or reward for it",1,event,19
"September 12, 1848"," He was and must be just the man to whom the interests, principles and prosperityPage 5
 of the country might be safely intrusted",1,demand,20
"September 12, 1848"," He had never failed in anything he had undertaken, although many of his duties had been considered almost impossible",1,event,21
"September 12, 1848","
 Mr",0,,
"September 12, 1848"," Lincoln then went into a terse though rapid review of the origin of the Mexican war and the connection of the administration and of General Taylor with it, from which he deduced a strong appeal to the Whigs present to do their duty in the support of General Taylor, and closed with the warmest aspirations for and confidence in a deserved success",1,event,21
"September 12, 1848","
 At the close of this truly masterly and convincing speech, the audience gave three enthusiastic cheers for Illinois, and three more for the eloquent Whig member from that State",1,event,21
"September 12, 1848",  5,0,,
"September 15, 1848",BOSTON WHIG CLUB,0,,
"September 15, 1848"," A full and enthusiastic meeting of this Club was held last evening at Washingtonian Hall, Bromfield street",0,,
"September 15, 1848", They were addressed by the Hon,0,,
"September 15, 1848"," Abraham Lincoln, of Illinois, in a speech of an hour and a half, which, for sound reasoning, cogent argument and keen satire, we have seldom heard equalled",0,,
"September 15, 1848"," He defended General Taylor from the charge that he had no principles, by showing conclusively that his avowed and well known principles were, that the people s will should be obeyed, and not frustrated by Executive usurpation and the interposition of the veto power",1,event,22
"September 15, 1848","
 He pointed out the absurdity of men who professed Whig principles supporting Van Buren, with all his Locofocoism, while the Whigs were as much opposed to the extension of slavery as were the Van Buren party",1,event,23
"September 15, 1848", His remarks were frequently interrupted by rounds of applause,0,,
"September 15, 1848"," As soon as he had concluded, the audience gave three cheers for Taylor and Fillmore, and three more for Mr",1,event,24
"September 15, 1848"," Lincoln, the Lone Star of Illinois, and then adjourned",1,event,24
"September 15, 1848", It was a glorious meeting,0,,
"September 16, 1848",Mr,0,,
"September 16, 1848", Woodman  2  introduced the Hon,0,,
"September 16, 1848"," Abraham Lincoln, of Illinois",0,,
"September 16, 1848", It would be doing injustice to his speech to endeavor to give a sketch of it,0,,
"September 16, 1848"," It was replete with good sense, sound reasoning, and irresistible argument, and spoken with that perfect command of manner and matter which so eminently distinguishes the Western orators",0,,
"September 16, 1848"," He disabused the public of the erroneous suppositions that Taylor was not a Whig  that Van Buren was anything more than a thorough Locofoco, on all subjects other than Free Territory, and hardly safe on that and showed up, in a masterly manner, the inconsistency and folly of those Whigs, who, being drawn off from the true and oldest free soil organization known among the parties of the Union, would now lend their influence and votes to help Mr",1,event,25
"September 16, 1848", Van Buren into the Presidential chair,0,,
"September 16, 1848"," His speech was interrupted by the cheers of the audience, evincing the truth of the great supposition that the dead can speak",1,event,25

September [21?] 1848,"The Taylor men were well entertained Wednesday evening, the 20th inst",0,,
September [21?] 1848,",  2  at Union Hall, by an address from the Hon",0,,
September [21?] 1848, Abraham Lincoln of Illinois,0,,
September [21?] 1848, The address as well as the speaker was such as to give unlimited satisfaction to the disheartened Taylorites,0,,
September [21?] 1848," Such a treat it is indeed seldom their good luck to get, and they were in ecstacies",0,,
September [21?] 1848," At former meetings their spirits were too low for a good hearty cheer, but on this occasion  the steam was up",0,,
September [21?] 1848,"  It was reviving to hear a man speak as if he believed what he was saying and had a grain or two of feeling mixed up with it  one who could not only speak highly of Taylor, but could occasionally swell with indignation or burst in hatred on the Free Soilers",0,,
September [21?] 1848," When political spite runs high nothing can be too pungent or severe, and the speaker is appreciated in proportion as his statements are rash and unscrupulous",0,,
September [21?] 1848, So it was no this occasion,0,,
September [21?] 1848," The speaker was far inferiorPage 7
 as a reasoner to others who hold the same views, but then he was more unscrupulous, more facetious and with his sneers he mixed up a good deal of humor",0,,
September [21?] 1848," His awkward gesticulations, the ludicrous management of his voice and the comical expression of his countenance, all conspired to make his hearers laugh at the mere anticipation of the joke before it appeared",0,,
September [21?] 1848, But enough concerning the speaker  let us examine his arguments,0,,
September [21?] 1848,"
 General Taylor, he argued, has principles, though he has not given expression to them on the Tariff, Bank and other questions of policy",1,event,26
September [21?] 1848," This, however, is in direct contradiction of Taylor, himself, who
 in his letter to Delany writes,  As regards the second and third inquiries  about a bank and tariff , I am not prepared to answer them",1,event,26
September [21?] 1848, I could only do so after investigating them,0,,
September [21?] 1848, I am no politician  near forty years of my life have been passed on the Western frontier and in the Indian count r y,1,fact,26
September [21?] 1848,"  The speaker next discussed the veto question and said that Taylor was the first Whig candidate that had come fully up to the Whig platform in this point, because unlike all other candidates before him he had not even claimed the right to advise Congress on matters of policy",1,event,26
September [21?] 1848," The proper limitation of the veto, he contended, was the Whig platform itself, and General Taylor by his equivocal silence had come up to it better than the great parent of Whig principles Henry Clay",1,event,26
September [21?] 1848," He did not know that General Taylor had professed that he would not veto the Wilmot proviso, but believed that he would not, because General Taylor had promised not to veto any measure unless it was unconstitutional or passed in haste and acknowledged that to be constitutional which had been established by long usage and acquiesced in by the people",1,event,26
September [21?] 1848, As the constitutionality of the Wilmot Proviso he said  had never been disputed,1,event,26
September [21?] 1848,  it was therefore acquiesced in by the people and consequently Taylor was bound not to veto it,1,event,26
September [21?] 1848,"
 He subsequently admitted in speaking of Cass, that in the Nicholson letter the constitutional power of Congress to exclude slavery from any territory in the Union was denied",1,event,26
September [21?] 1848," Yet he seemed to forget this when he said that the
 constitutionality of the Proviso had never been disputed",1,event,26
September [21?] 1848," He seemed to be entirely ignorant that every propagandist of slavery in existence, with John C",1,event,26
September [21?] 1848," Calhoun at their head, claimed the right, under the Constitution, and independent of Congress, to carry their  property  into any part of the United States territory and there to hold it",1,event,27
September [21?] 1848,"
 Calhoun said in the Senate that when the South consented to the Missouri Compromise the rights of the South granted by the Constitution were given up but belonged to the South the same asPage 8
 if no compromise had been made",1,event,28
September [21?] 1848, Thomas Corwin said in his speech on the Compromise Bill introduced in the Senate last session of Congress that the constitutionality of any measure excluding slavery from the territories could not with safety be left to the decision of the Supreme Court,1,event,29
September [21?] 1848, The House of Representatives had the same views and rejected the bill,1,event,29
September [21?] 1848," None of these facts did the speaker allude to, but instead uttered the
 stupendous falsehood that the  constitutionality of the Proviso  had never been disputed",1,event,29
September [21?] 1848," Without this  whopper,  however, the argument would have been defective",1,demand,29
September [21?] 1848," There would have been a gap in it, so the lie was made big enough to fill the gap that the argument might thereby be made sound and conclusive",1,event,29
September [21?] 1848,"
 He related a conversation which he overheard at the dinner table of a house in Lowell between two Free Soilers",1,event,29
September [21?] 1848," One of them remarked that the reasoning of the Taylor men was not logical, for it certainly was illogical to say,  General Taylor is a slaveholder, therefore we go for him to prevent the extension of slavery",1,event,29
September [21?] 1848,"  He thought this was an unfair statement of the case and gave what he deemed the correct one in the form of a syllogism as follows   General Taylor is a slaveholder, but he will do more to prevent the extension of slavery than any other man whom it is possible to elect, therefore we go for Taylor",1,event,29
September [21?] 1848," 
 It needs no argument to prove that the major proposition does not include the minor o n e and has nothing to do with it",1,fact,29
September [21?] 1848, But let that pass,0,,
September [21?] 1848," The minor proposition asserts that General Taylor will do  more  to prevent the extension of slavery than any other man it is possible to elect, and this assertion is made before the logician has even attempted to prove that General Taylor was opposed to the extension of slavery at all  The attempt is made to prove that he will do more than any other man before it is proved that he will do the first thing",1,demand,30
September [21?] 1848, But taking for granted that General Taylor will not veto the Proviso  a position founded on a lie  is that a proof that he will do anything to prevent the extension of slavery  He may never have a chance to veto the Proviso even if elected in November,1,demand,30
September [21?] 1848, The slave states are equal with the free states in the Senate and before the Proviso can pass that body one or two of the Southern Senators must yield,1,demand,31
September [21?] 1848,"
 Under such circumstances, is it likely that any Senator from the South will be influenced to vote for the Proviso by the executive patronage of the unrepentant slaveholder, Zachary Taylor  Is it not more probable that it would be brought to bear on some Northern doughface  It would be quite safe for Taylor to make an equivocal promise not to veto the Proviso, but he has not even done soPage 9
 much as that",1,demand,32
September [21?] 1848, The speaker contended that Van Buren had approved the policy of the Mexican War and the annexation of new territory,1,event,32
September [21?] 1848, This he did not prove from Van Buren s letter written in 1844,0,,
September [21?] 1848," If he had read that letter to his hearers they would have found that Van Buren wrote against annexation, partly because it would produce war",1,event,32
September [21?] 1848, The proof he gave was the fact that some of the same individuals who supported Van Buren in 1844 had since voted both for Texas and war,1,event,32
September [21?] 1848,"
 He said in another part of his speech that the Northern Democrats were opposed to the annexation of Texas in 1844",1,event,33
September [21?] 1848, Yet he undertook to prove that Van Buren was in favor of annexation and war from the fact that these men once supported him and that at the very time they themselves were opposed to annexation,1,event,33
September [21?] 1848, But why should Van Buren be held responsible for all his friends  Where is the proof that he ever favored the extension of slavery in all his life  Is General Taylor responsible for all who now support him  Are the sins of Berrien Mangum and other propagandists of slavery to be laid to his charge  He has enough to answer for his own account if we acquit him of all guilt connected with the Native Church burning of Philadelphia,1,demand,33
September [21?] 1848,"
 To show the recklessness and audacity of the honorable gentleman and the low estimate he had formed of his hearers, it will suffice to give but one specimen",1,event,34
September [21?] 1848," Speaking of Van Buren, he said,  he  Van Buren  won t have an electoral vote in the nation nor as many as all others in any county in the nation",1,demand,34
September [21?] 1848,  The reasoning adopted by the Whig Free Soilers he gave in the form of a syllogism as follows   We can t go for General Taylor because he is not a Whig,1,event,35
September [21?] 1848," Van Buren is not a Whig  therefore, we go for him",0,,
September [21?] 1848,  This dishonest statement of the case elicited warm applause from his truth loving hearers,1,event,35
September [21?] 1848, The syllogism should have stood thus  We can t vote for a man without principles,1,demand,36
September [21?] 1848," General Taylor has got none, and Van Buren has, at least, got one good Whig principle  therefore, we go for Van Buren against Taylor",1,event,37
September [21?] 1848,"
 For the benefit of those who are like the speaker, always misrepresenting the Free Soil Party, I will define our position in a prosyllogism",1,demand,38
September [21?] 1848, The abolition of slavery in the territory of the United States can never be accomplished unless the North is united,1,demand,39
September [21?] 1848, But the North cannot be united until old party lines are broken down,1,demand,39
September [21?] 1848," But these lines cannot be broken down unless every man is willing to sacrifice his attachment to minor questions and make opposition to slavery the leading idea  therefore, we have come out of the old pro slavery parties and formed the United Party of the North",1,demand,39
"September 25-30, 1848","Niagara Falls  By what mysterious power is it that millions and millions, are drawn from all parts of the world, to gaze upon Niagara Falls  There is no mystery about the thing itself",1,event,40
"September 25-30, 1848"," Every effect is just such as any inteligent man knowing the causes, would anticipate, without  seeing  it",1,fact,41
"September 25-30, 1848"," If the water moving onward in a great river, reaches a point where there is a perpendicular jog, of a hundred feet in descent, in the bottom of the river, it is plain the water will have a violent and continuous plunge at that point",1,demand,42
"September 25-30, 1848"," It is also plain the water, thus plunging, will foam, and roar, and send up a mist, continuously, in which last, during sunshine, there will be perpetual rain bows",1,demand,42
"September 25-30, 1848", The mere physical of Niagara Falls is only this,0,,
"September 25-30, 1848", Yet this is really a very small part of that world s wonder,0,,
"September 25-30, 1848"," It s power to excite reflection, and emotion, is it s great charm",0,,
"September 25-30, 1848"," The geologist will demonstrate that the plunge, or fall, was once at Lake Ontario, and has worn it s way back to it s present position  he will ascertain how fast it is wearing now, and so get a basis for determining how long it has been wearing back from Lake Ontario, and finally demonstrate by it that this world is at least fourteen thousand years old",1,demand,43
"September 25-30, 1848", A philosopher of a slightly different turn will say Niagara Falls is only the lip of the basin out of which pours all the surplus water which rains down on two or three hundred thousand square miles of the earth s surface,1,demand,44
"September 25-30, 1848"," He will estim ate with  approximate accuracy, that five hundred thousand  to ns of water, falls with it s full weight, a distance of a hundred feet each minute thus exerting a force equal to the lifting of the same weight, through the same space, in the same time",1,demand,44
"September 25-30, 1848"," And then the further reflection comes that this vast amount of water, constantly pouring down, is supplied by an equal amount constantly lifted up, by the sun  and still he says,  If this much is lifted up, for this one space of two or three hundred thousand square miles, an equal amount must be lifted for every other equal space, and he is overwhelmed in the contemplation of the vast power the sun is constantly exerting in quiet, noiseless opperation of lifting water up to be rained down again",1,event,44
"September 25-30, 1848","
 But still there is more",0,,
"September 25-30, 1848", It calls up the indefinite past,0,,
"September 25-30, 1848"," When Columbus first sought this continent when Christ suffered on the cross when Moses led Israel through the Red Sea nay, even, when Adam first came from the hand of his Maker then as now, Niagara was roaring here",1,event,45
"September 25-30, 1848"," The eyes of that species of extinct giants, whose bones fill the mounds of America, have gazed on Niagara, asPage 11
 ours do now",1,event,46
"September 25-30, 1848"," Co n temporary with the whole race of men, and older than the first man, Niagara is strong, and fresh to day as ten thousand years ago",1,fact,47
"September 25-30, 1848"," The Mammoth and Mastadon now so long dead, that fragments of their monstrous bones, alone testify, that they ever lived, have gazed on Niagara",1,event,48

"September 25-30, 1848"," Never dried, never froze, never slept, never rested,",0,,
"October 6, 1848"," Lincoln s speech occupied about two hours, which time he devoted to a most earnest, candid and logical examination of the great questions involved in the present Presidential canvass",1,event,49

 Mr",0,,
"February 13, 1849"," LINCOLN said he had not risen for the purpose of making a speech, but only for the purpose of meeting some of the objections to the bill",1,event,112
"February 13, 1849","  2  If he understood those objections, the first was, that if the bill were to become a law, it would be used to lock large portions of the public lands from sale, without at last effecting the ostensible object of the bill the construction of railroads in the new States  and secondly, that Congress would be forced to the abandonment of large portions of the public lands to the States for which they might be reserved, without their paying for them",1,event,112
"February 13, 1849", This he understood to be the substance of the objections of the gentleman from Ohio  3  to the passage of the bill,0,,
"February 13, 1849","
 If he could get the attention of the House for a few minutes, he would ask gentlemen to tell us what motive could induce any State Legislature, or individual, or company of individuals, of the new States to expend money in surveying roads which they might know they could not make   A VOICE  They are not required to make the road",1,demand,112
"February 13, 1849"," 
 Mr",0,,
"February 13, 1849"," LINCOLN,  continuing",0,,
"February 13, 1849",  That was not the case he was making,0,,
"February 13, 1849"," What motive would tempt any set of men to go into an expensive survey of a railroad, which they did not intend to make  What good would it do  Did men act without motive  Did business men commonly go into an expenditure of money, which could be of no account to them  He generally found that men who have money were disposed to hold on to it, unless they could see something to be made by its investment",1,fact,112
"February 13, 1849"," He could not see what motive of advantage to the new States could be subserved by merely keeping the public lands out of market, and preventing their settlement",1,event,113
"February 13, 1849"," As far as he could see, the new States were wholly without any motive to do such a thing",1,fact,113
"February 13, 1849"," This, then, he took to be a good answer to the first objection",0,,
"February 13, 1849","
 In relation to the fact assumed, that, after a while, the new States having got hold of the public lands to a certain extent, they would turn round and compel Congress to relinquish all claim to them, he had a word to say, by way of recurring to the history of the past",1,event,114
"February 13, 1849"," When was the time to come  he asked  when the States in which the public lands were situated would compose a majority of the representation in Congress, or anything like it  A majority of Representatives would very soon reside west of the mountains, he admitted  but would they all come from States in which thePage 27
 public lands were situated  They certainly would not  for, as these western States grew strong in Congress, the public lands passed away from them, and they got on the other side of the question  and the gentleman from Ohio  Mr",1,event,114
"February 13, 1849", VINTON  was an example attesting that fact,0,,

 Mr",0,,

"February 13, 1849","
 Mr",0,,
"February 13, 1849", LINCOLN was not making an argument for the purpose of convicting the gentleman of any impropriety at all,1,event,115
"February 13, 1849"," He was speaking of a fact in history, of which his State was an example",0,,
"February 13, 1849", He was referring to a plain principle in the nature of things,1,event,116
"February 13, 1849", The State of Ohio had now grown to be a giant,0,,
"February 13, 1849"," She had a large delegation on that floor  but was she now in favor of granting lands to the new States, as she used to be  The New England States, New York, and the Old Thirteen, were all rather quiet upon the subject  and it was seen just now that a member from one of the new States was the first man to rise up in opposition",1,event,117
"February 13, 1849", And so it would be with the history of this question for the future,0,,
"February 13, 1849", There never would come a time when the people residing in the States embracing the public lands would have the entire control of this subject  and so it was a matter of certainty that Congress would never do more in this respect than what would be dictated by a just liberality,1,demand,118
"February 13, 1849"," The apprehension, therefore, that the public lands were in danger of being wrested from the General Government by the strength of the delegation in Congress from the new States, was utterly futile",1,event,119
"February 13, 1849", There never could be such a thing,0,,
"February 13, 1849", If we take these lands  said he  it will not be without your consent,0,,
"February 13, 1849", We can never outnumber you,0,,
"February 13, 1849"," The result is, that all fear of the new States turning against the right of Congress to the public domain must be effectually quelled, as those who are opposed to that interest must always hold a vast majority here, and they will never surrender the whole or any part of the public lands unless they themselves choose so to do",1,demand,120

 To all whom it may concern 
 Be it known that I, Abraham Lincoln, of Springfield, in the county of Sangamon, in the state of Illinois, have invented a new and improved manner of combining adjustable buoyant air chambers with a steam boat or other vessel for the purpose of enabling their draught of water to be readily lessened to enable them to pass over bars, or through shallow water, without discharging their cargoes  and I do hereby declare the following to be a full, clear, and exact description thereof, reference being had to the accompanying drawings making a part of this specification",0,,
"March 10, 1849", Similar letters indicate like parts in all the figures,0,,
"March 10, 1849","
 The buoyant chambers A",0,,

"March 10, 1849"," which I employ, are constructed in such a manner that they can be expanded so as to hold a large volume of air when required for use, and can be contracted, into a very small space and safely secured as soon as their services can be dispensed with",0,,

"March 10, 1849","
 The top g, and bottom h, of each buoyant chamber, is composed of plank or metal, of suitable strength and stiffness, and the flexible sides and ends of the chambers, are composed of india rubber cloth, or other suitable water proof fabric, securely united to the edges and ends of the top and bottom of the chambers",0,,

 The sides of the chambers may be stayed and supported centrally by a frame k, as shown in Fig",0,,

 Page 35From Nicolay and Hay, Abraham Lincoln  A History
 the chambers can be expanded at the same time, and by disconnecting them, either pair of chambers can be expanded, separately from the others as circumstances may require",0,,
"March 10, 1849","
 The buoyant chambers may be operated by the power of the steam engine applied to the main shaft C, in any convenient manner, or by man power",0,,

 Where the guards of a vessel are very high above the water, the boxes B",0,,

 When it is desired to combine my expansible buoyant chambers with vessels which have no projecting guards  shelves or cases must be strongly fastened to their sides for the reception of the buoyant chambers",0,,
"March 10, 1849","
 I wish it to be distinctly understood, that I do not intend to limit myself to any particular mechanical arrangement, in combining expansible buoyant chambers with a vessel, but shall vary the same as I may deem expedient, whilst I attain the same end by substantially the same means",0,,
"March 10, 1849"," What I claim as my invention and desire to secure by letters patent, is the combination of expansible buoyant chambers placed at the sides of a vessel, with the main shaft or shafts C, by means of the sliding spars, or shafts D, which pass down through the buoyant chambers and are made fast to their bottoms, and the series of ropes and pullies, or their equivalents, in such a manner that by turning the main shaft or shafts in one direction, the buoyant chambers will be forced downwards into the water and at the same time expanded and filled with air for buoying up the vessel by the displacement of water  and by turning the shaft in an opposite direction, the buoyant chambers will be contracted into a small space and secured against injury",0,,
