volume52_book_384.txt,"December 25, 1932","LETTER TO T. S. KALYANA RAMA IYER December 25, 1932 DEAR FRIEND, I thank you for your long letter."
volume52_book_384.txt,"December 25, 1932",You are at liberty to publish your own letter and this reply.
volume52_book_384.txt,"December 25, 1932","In the first place, it seems to me that you have misconstrued the proposed Bill."
volume52_book_384.txt,"December 25, 1932","It is not sought to impose the views of a minority on the majority, but it is sought to restore the condition as it was before the decisions of Courts gave a permanent legal effect to a custom."
volume52_book_384.txt,"December 25, 1932","Whilst a particular custom is in vogue without at any stage being made permanent by decisions of a Court or by legislation, it becomes stagnant and is not liable to the gradual and imperceptible change that every healthy custom undergoes in process of time and under pressure of the demand of the public governed by that particular custom."
volume52_book_384.txt,"December 25, 1932",The proposed Bill will so alter the Court-made Law as to make it possible for the public interested by a majority to change the then existing custom.
volume52_book_384.txt,"December 25, 1932","Instances are not wanting in Hinduism to prove that even the interpretations of accepted Shastras have suffered evolution, so much so that in some cases the original meaning has completely gone into disuse."
volume52_book_384.txt,"December 25, 1932",All the fears that you have described in your letter are in my opinion groundless for the reason I have stated.
volume52_book_384.txt,"December 25, 1932","You will admit that there are rival schools of interpretation of the Agamas, as also there are Shastris who question the authenticity of certain Agamas."
volume52_book_384.txt,"December 25, 1932","If Hinduism was not in a decaying condition, we would not find those versed in Vedic lore supine, whilst gross superstition is defiling a religion that was once pure and had inherent capacity for continually throwing out impurities and responding to the call of the age."
volume52_book_384.txt,"December 25, 1932",I can only give you my assurance that I have no desire whatsoever to do violence to Hindu public feeling or to ignore the Shastras on which Hinduism is A LETTER 285 based.
volume52_book_384.txt,"December 25, 1932","I have, however, reserved to myself the right to determine according to my light the choice of interpretation in the midst of a variety, or even in all humility to give a new interpretation where in rare instances I feel the capacity for it, and this practice is quite consistent with the spirit of Hinduism."
volume52_book_384.txt,"December 25, 1932","We would not have a variety of interpretations and make them acceptable to a large number of Hindus, not always ignorant of Shastras."
volume52_book_384.txt,"December 25, 1932","You say that whenever an idol is polluted, all that is needed to restore its purity is to do so by authorized purification.1 Since there is no method of guarding an idol against pollution by the surreptitious entry of an untouchable or others who are prohibited from entering a particular temple, and since there is no infallible method of detecting intruders before they come within the pollution distance, does it not follow that the ceremony of purification has to be gone through every day in order to retain the efficacy of the idol?"
volume52_book_384.txt,"December 25, 1932","Again, how would you guard against the so-called untouchables declining to be classed as such and insisting upon being classified as savarna Hindus at the next census?"
volume52_book_384.txt,"December 25, 1932",Do you contemplate courts of inquisition for determining the birth-status of tens of thousands of Hindus?
volume52_book_384.txt,"December 25, 1932","If the Agamas, or rather the custodians of the Agamas, were at all alive to their trust, they would recognize the spirit of the age and draw from the very Shastras a meaning consistent with it."
volume52_book_242.txt,"December 13, 1932","LETTER TO C. V. VAIDYA December 13, 1932 I was delighted to receive your letter1 so full and instructive."
volume52_book_242.txt,"December 13, 1932","I wish you could have discussed your position with me before sending your letter to the Premier; but nothing is lost yet, and if you can conveniently spare the time, I would love to see you and discuss the thing with you."
volume52_book_242.txt,"December 13, 1932","Meanwhile, I present my doubts: 1."
volume52_book_242.txt,"December 13, 1932",Do you mean to say that under no circumstances can Hindu Law or Hindu practice be changed by Hindu public opinion?
volume52_book_242.txt,"December 13, 1932",Do you say that Smritis are unalterable and that everything said in them has to be carried out to the letter by a devout Hindu?
volume52_book_242.txt,"December 13, 1932",Were not Smritis written or revealed in response to the requirements of the age in which they were written?
volume52_book_242.txt,"December 13, 1932",Were not the Smritis written at different times?
volume52_book_242.txt,"December 13, 1932","If you hold that under no conceivable circumstance can legislation alter prevailing practice, how would you deal with the legal difficulty which is supposed to exist in Madras, viz., that even one man can under the law decided by the present courts, prevent the entry of untouchables to certain temples in spite of the consensus of public opinion in favour of such entry?"
volume52_book_242.txt,"December 13, 1932","1 Dated December 8, 1932 which read: "" ."
volume52_book_242.txt,"December 13, 1932","I have addressed a letter (dated November 18, 1932) to Mr. Ramsay MacDonald, President, 3rd R.T.C."
volume52_book_242.txt,"December 13, 1932","The reason which led me to address the letter is that I apprehend that hasty reformers will force by legislation, temple-entry and such like reforms down the throats of the orthodox Hindus of India who are voiceless, not being represented in the R.T.C."
volume52_book_242.txt,"December 13, 1932",or the Legislative Councils.
volume52_book_242.txt,"December 13, 1932","Subsequently came your declaration published in The Times of India, that if you had the power you would make it an offence under the Penal Code for anyone to refuse to touch the Harijans."
volume52_book_242.txt,"December 13, 1932","This was the last straw that broke the back of my silence and I at once addressed a letter on the subject to Mr. Ramsay MacDonald, President, 3rd R.T.C., requesting him to introduce a section in the new Constitution like the one existing in the present Government of India Act, prohibiting future legislatures from passing any laws forcing reforms in religious and socio-religious matters."
volume52_book_242.txt,"December 13, 1932","I feel strongly on the subject of noninterference by the State Legislatures in such matters and I thought it my duty to do what I can for it at this juncture"" (S.N."

volume52_book_242.txt,"December 13, 1932","Or, do you hold that the existing temples can never be opened to untouchables?"
volume52_book_242.txt,"December 13, 1932","Or, is not your opposition to legislation based on the assumption that the mixed legislatures would be interfering with Hindu religion, although if Hindu opinion was taken, such legislation would be found to have no public backing?"
volume52_book_242.txt,"December 13, 1932",What objection would you see to the mere Hindu legislators first passing legislation regarding Hindu religion and then for the sake of formality it being passed by the whole House or Houses as the case may be.
volume52_book_242.txt,"December 13, 1932","9. Who are untouchables according to the Vedas, or, if you like, traditional Hindu religion?"
volume52_book_242.txt,"December 13, 1932",Does untouchability attach to birth and persist from generation to generation?
volume52_book_242.txt,"December 13, 1932",Is such untouchability incurable by any penance or purification undergone by such untouchables?
volume52_book_242.txt,"December 13, 1932",Is prohibition against interdining and intermarriage an integral part of varna dharma?
volume52_book_242.txt,"December 13, 1932",Is varna dharma fully performed if a man belonging to one varna desists from dining with those belonging to a different varna and from contracting marriage relations with people of a different varna?
volume52_book_242.txt,"December 13, 1932",Does a person so interdining or intermarrying forfeit his varna?
volume52_book_242.txt,"December 13, 1932","Is not occupation the test of varna, and does not a person who changes his occupation, say, Brahmin, to that of another varna, pass on to that varna, or, it may be, forfeit his right to any varna at all?"
volume52_book_242.txt,"December 13, 1932","I will not exhaust your patience nor tax your energy by adding to the already long list of questions, nor do I want you to burn midnight oil in order to be prompt in your reply, as you always are."
volume52_book_242.txt,"December 13, 1932",Perhaps you will be able to give in a sentence or two an exhaustive answer which will cover all the points that have occurred to me.
volume52_book_242.txt,"December 13, 1932","Anyway I shall look forward to your reply, and still more eagerly to your saying that you will make time to come to Yeravda to see me."
volume52_book_242.txt,"December 13, 1932","I suppose you are older than I am, but I am sure that it does not interfere with your vigour."
volume92_book_548.txt,"August 7, 1932","LETTER TO MATHURADAS P. ASAR [Before August 7, 1932]1 CHI."
volume92_book_548.txt,"August 7, 1932","MATHURADAS, I have your letter."
volume92_book_548.txt,"August 7, 1932",The hook for the cup has not yet arrived.
volume92_book_548.txt,"August 7, 1932",I am not even ready to use it as yet.
volume92_book_548.txt,"August 7, 1932",Every day the cup is before my eyes.
volume92_book_548.txt,"August 7, 1932",It has not been our intention to go on increasing the count.
volume92_book_548.txt,"August 7, 1932",I am going to be steady at around 40 counts myself.
volume92_book_548.txt,"August 7, 1932",Most probably it will be the same in the case of Sardar.
volume92_book_548.txt,"August 7, 1932",Mahadev may settle at around 80 counts.
volume92_book_548.txt,"August 7, 1932",Then testing it would be the thing to do.
volume92_book_548.txt,"August 7, 1932",It would be easy to see the result.
volume92_book_548.txt,"August 7, 1932","If the yarn is even and does not break while being taken off and is tightly wound round the spindle, then the yarn is not likely to be weak."
volume92_book_548.txt,"August 7, 1932","On the other hand, there are chances of being cheated in the tests made using the cup or the machine used in a mill."
volume92_book_548.txt,"August 7, 1932",The yarn cannot be unwound from just any place.
volume92_book_548.txt,"August 7, 1932",There would be much waste in doing so.
volume92_book_548.txt,"August 7, 1932","Hence, only if the yarn is even from the point of unwinding can it stand the test."
volume92_book_548.txt,"August 7, 1932",This means that yarn can be tested only by the weaver.
volume92_book_548.txt,"August 7, 1932",The yarn which can be used for weaving without difficulty is good yarn.
volume92_book_548.txt,"August 7, 1932",But the purpose of writing is not to disregard the tools of yarn-testing.
volume92_book_548.txt,"August 7, 1932",My purpose is only to indicate the time for doing the test.
volume92_book_548.txt,"August 7, 1932",At one time I used to do the testing every day.
volume92_book_548.txt,"August 7, 1932",I had prepared the tool for the purpose with the materials available at home.
volume92_book_548.txt,"August 7, 1932","1 From the contents the letter appears to have been written before the one to the addressee of August 7, 1932; vide Vol."
volume92_book_548.txt,"August 7, 1932",LETTER TO MATHURADAS P. ASAR 329 But then I found that it was taking a lot of time.
volume92_book_548.txt,"August 7, 1932",And I was not able to effect much improvement thereby.
volume92_book_548.txt,"August 7, 1932","I also saw that where I only used my guess instead of the test, my guess frequently turned out to be correct, because, while unwinding the yarn, it would have passed before the eyes."
volume92_book_548.txt,"August 7, 1932",One would also know how often it has broken and also how well the yarn has been wound on the spindle.
volume92_book_548.txt,"August 7, 1932","And so, an intelligent spinner automatically gets an idea about the quality of his yarn."
volume92_book_548.txt,"August 7, 1932",Otherwise you are absolutely correct in arguing that there is no reason to gloat over the fact if the yarn is of 100 counts on weighing.
volume92_book_548.txt,"August 7, 1932",I know that there can be yarn of 100 counts fit only to be thrown away.
volume92_book_548.txt,"August 7, 1932",I have also seen such yarn.
volume92_book_548.txt,"August 7, 1932",Any attempt to spin such yarn is sheer waste of time.
volume92_book_548.txt,"August 7, 1932","Hence, anyone spinning fine yarn should be convinced that the yarn will easily be turned into a length of cloth."
volume92_book_548.txt,"August 7, 1932","Then alone can the yarn be considered as of good quality, otherwise it is useless."
volume92_book_548.txt,"August 7, 1932",That is why I had written to Narandas two or three months ago that he should make arrangements for the weaving of fine yarn.
volume92_book_548.txt,"August 7, 1932",Your report about the Yajnik Sewing Machine is interesting.
volume92_book_548.txt,"August 7, 1932",If we get volunteers in thousands involved in the .
volume92_book_548.txt,"August 7, 1932",".1 right at the beginning, the experiment will not go very far."
volume92_book_548.txt,"August 7, 1932","Hence, we must invent something which will ensure proper use of the hand needle and does not take much time."
volume92_book_548.txt,"August 7, 1932",It is only with this in view that I have kept embroidery and knitting in my mind.
volume92_book_548.txt,"August 7, 1932","The art of Yajnik sewing is not for making available to the poor readymade khadi garments, but for quick disposal of the khadi woven by the poor without loss."
volume92_book_548.txt,"August 7, 1932",It is for making expensive-looking khadi inexpensive.
volume92_book_548.txt,"August 7, 1932","But if we expect from a fairly wealthy person that he shall buy khadi however expensive and however coarse it may be, and then get it stitched at his own expense, then khadi cannot go very far."
volume92_book_548.txt,"August 7, 1932","Alternatively khadi should be sold at a loss or the spinning charges, etc., should be brought down."
volume92_book_548.txt,"August 7, 1932",In your plan I saw the suggestion to avoid doing that and so I promptly welcomed it.
volume92_book_548.txt,"August 7, 1932",Hence you should convince the ladies who have protested that they should feel gratified that they adorned the khadi woven by the poor by stitching it free and serving the poor.
volume92_book_548.txt,"August 7, 1932","For, by their action, the stitched garments could be sold at the price of unwashed khadi and we could pay the poor their full wages."
volume92_book_548.txt,"August 7, 1932",We can certainly make an inexpensive sewing-machine in this country; but I think it can only be an imitation of the machine in vogue at present.
volume92_book_548.txt,"August 7, 1932","If so, it should mean overriding 1 Unclear in the original 330 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI the patent law."
volume92_book_548.txt,"August 7, 1932","The Singer and other machines have invested capital of millions of rupees and wherever patent laws prevail, they must be registering their patents."
volume92_book_548.txt,"August 7, 1932","But I am not fully conversant with the situation, and if somebody invents an original design and prepares a sewing-machine which is simpler than the machines currently in use, he himself can earn millions by registering his patent."
volume92_book_548.txt,"August 7, 1932","Because, he would then compete with the Singer machine."
volume92_book_548.txt,"August 7, 1932",Our craftsmanship has still not inspired such confidence in me.
volume92_book_548.txt,"August 7, 1932","In the West, there are countless new inventions every day."
volume92_book_548.txt,"August 7, 1932",But that is not our field at all.
volume92_book_548.txt,"August 7, 1932",Something like that has no doubt been in my mind.
volume92_book_548.txt,"August 7, 1932",Our ancestors invented the greatest thing in the shape of the spinning-wheel.
volume92_book_548.txt,"August 7, 1932",Millions of people have benefited from it.
volume92_book_548.txt,"August 7, 1932",Textile machinery is based on the design of the spinning-wheel.
volume92_book_548.txt,"August 7, 1932",Hence there is still much scope in the direction of improvement of the spinning-wheel.
volume92_book_548.txt,"August 7, 1932",I am sure that something will emerge.
volume92_book_548.txt,"August 7, 1932","There can be a profit of millions, but there is no chance for a single individual to earn millions."
volume92_book_548.txt,"August 7, 1932",Now about your diet.
volume92_book_548.txt,"August 7, 1932",You have done well to give up starches.
volume92_book_548.txt,"August 7, 1932",Equally important is the point about pulses.
volume92_book_548.txt,"August 7, 1932","If the curd is absolutely sweet (not sour), it can never cause headache."
volume92_book_548.txt,"August 7, 1932","To make it safe, a little soda may be added to it."
volume92_book_548.txt,"August 7, 1932","But if one can take milk, there is no need to take curd."
volume92_book_548.txt,"August 7, 1932",It is only superstition that papaw is harmful to the eyes.
volume92_book_548.txt,"August 7, 1932",Any person can test this fact by taking only papaw.
volume92_book_548.txt,"August 7, 1932",He should take nothing else with it.
volume92_book_548.txt,"August 7, 1932",This can be tested by having a single meal of papaw.
volume92_book_548.txt,"August 7, 1932",There is no need to entertain such a superstition even with regard to ripe tomatoes.
volume92_book_548.txt,"August 7, 1932","Your diet can consist of thin chapati, green vegetables and milk."
volume92_book_548.txt,"August 7, 1932",You must have something sweet.
volume92_book_548.txt,"August 7, 1932","You can take currants, black grape or raisins."
volume92_book_548.txt,"August 7, 1932","Raw onion can do you good, but it can be taken only in the evening because I know that it gives off a terrible smell."
volume92_book_548.txt,"August 7, 1932",I have myself eaten lots of raw onions.
volume92_book_548.txt,"August 7, 1932",I did it only in the evening and avoided meeting anyone afterwards.
volume92_book_548.txt,"August 7, 1932",But the tolerance of our women is infinite.
volume92_book_548.txt,"August 7, 1932","But since Ba has been in the habit of making free comments over the years, she could not hold herself from remarking on the matter."
volume92_book_548.txt,"August 7, 1932",And in the end she always warned me against going before anyone else with my mouth stinking.
volume92_book_548.txt,"August 7, 1932",And she was absolutely right.
volume92_book_548.txt,"August 7, 1932",I am afraid your digestive system cannot accept almonds.
volume92_book_548.txt,"August 7, 1932",Do not go on brooding about your diet.
volume92_book_548.txt,"August 7, 1932",Do not brood over your illness either.
volume92_book_548.txt,"August 7, 1932","Once you have decided about something, it should be taken as settled."
volume92_book_548.txt,"August 7, 1932",Taking a vow only means that our mind stops bothering about it after the vow has been taken.
volume92_book_548.txt,"August 7, 1932","Just as a trader LETTER TO DR. M. A. ANSARI 331 does not bother about the thing he has already sold and starts thinking about the next thing, so also the mind."

volume51_book_602.txt,"November 8, 1932","JAMNALAL, Your letter was delivered to me just now."
volume51_book_602.txt,"November 8, 1932",It was immediately read out to me and I am now dictating this reply.

volume51_book_602.txt,"November 8, 1932","Why should we fear death, which comes to all sooner or later-to the great and the humble, to the white and the black, to human beings and other creatures?"
volume51_book_602.txt,"November 8, 1932",Why grieve over it either?
volume51_book_602.txt,"November 8, 1932",I often feel that death must be a less painful event than birth.
volume51_book_602.txt,"November 8, 1932",I leave aside the pain which the baby suffers in the mother's womb before birth.
volume51_book_602.txt,"November 8, 1932",But all of us know the suffering in this world which commences from the moment of birth.
volume51_book_602.txt,"November 8, 1932",Consider the helplessness of the baby at the moment of birth-every baby as helpless as any other.
volume51_book_602.txt,"November 8, 1932","On the other hand, if our life has been pure we shall have no such experience at the moment of death."
volume51_book_602.txt,"November 8, 1932","A baby does not seek knowledge, nor can it have any."
volume51_book_602.txt,"November 8, 1932","At the time of death, on the other hand, it is not only possible for one to be in a state of union with the Brahman but we actually know that many persons die in such a state."
volume51_book_602.txt,"November 8, 1932","Birth always means entering a world of suffering, whereas death can be complete deliverance from suffering."
volume51_book_602.txt,"November 8, 1932","We can thus think from many points of view about the beauty and the benefits of death, and can also meet our death in that spirit."
volume51_book_602.txt,"November 8, 1932",I bless you that your death may be of this type.
volume51_book_602.txt,"November 8, 1932",This wish includes everything else which is for your good.
volume51_book_602.txt,"November 8, 1932",The two friends join me in wishing this.

volume51_book_602.txt,"November 8, 1932","You should not ask for or accept even a grain of jaggery to gratify your palate, but I see nothing wrong in your trying and getting even the costliest variety of grapes if you need them as medicine and if they can be had."

volume51_book_602.txt,"November 8, 1932","If we can, we should also help others who may be placed in similar circumstances to secure such food."
volume51_book_602.txt,"November 8, 1932",In my view you don't require all the wheat that is supplied to you.
volume51_book_602.txt,"November 8, 1932",I also think it desirable for you to banish jaggery altogether from your food.
volume51_book_602.txt,"November 8, 1932",Your body does not require it at all.
volume51_book_602.txt,"November 8, 1932",It is better to take innocent honey instead.
volume51_book_602.txt,"November 8, 1932",Mixing any form of sugar in milk affects its digestibility.
volume51_book_602.txt,"November 8, 1932",It would be better to increase the quantity of milk instead.
volume51_book_602.txt,"November 8, 1932",You are doing right in eating butter and not olive oil.
volume51_book_602.txt,"November 8, 1932","The olive oil available in India is not always pure, and of course it cannot be fresh."

volume51_book_602.txt,"November 8, 1932",The vegetables which you eat should always be green vegetables.

volume51_book_481.txt,"October 24, 1932",I can have no objection to the presence of an official or officials at the interviews and inspection there and then of correspondence.

volume51_book_481.txt,"October 24, 1932",Naturally these interviews and correspondence should have no reference to civil disobedience and must be strictly limited to the removal of untouchability.

volume51_book_481.txt,"October 24, 1932",I did not give my son a copy of the reply.
volume51_book_481.txt,"October 24, 1932",I add that my son out of nobility of his nature wrote a gentlemanly letter to Mr. Hudson regretting that Maulana Shaukat Ali had published his conversation with him in spite of his caution.
volume51_book_481.txt,"October 24, 1932","He had expected a letter of thanks in reply for his frankness but unfortunately he received a reprimand, and he remained quiet under it."
volume51_book_481.txt,"October 24, 1932",I should be sorry if after this very full explanation Mr. Hudson does not revise his opinion and think that as man to man he has done me a grave injustice.

volume49_book_218.txt,"March 11, 1932",You will have to appreciate my feelings in this matter by remembering that I have been interested in the condition of these classes from my boyhood and have more than once staked my all for their sake.
volume49_book_218.txt,"March 11, 1932",I say this not to pride myself in any way.
volume49_book_218.txt,"March 11, 1932","For, I feel that no penance that caste Hindus may do can, in any way, compensate for the calculated degradation to which they have consigned the Depressed Classes for centuries."

volume52_book_284.txt,"December 17, 1932","Surely, it ought to be easy for you to see that since you admit that untouchability is quite contrary to the divine fact of oneness of all life, the only way to realize that oneness1 is to have as little differentiation as possible, and wherever it exists, it should be accepted as an evil to be removed at the first opportunity."
volume52_book_284.txt,"December 17, 1932",There is no such difficulty or impossibility about the removal of untouchability as we practise it today.
volume52_book_284.txt,"December 17, 1932","You say that untouchability is based on ""physical, moral and mental purity"", and you have stated as if it was a self-proved proposition."

volume52_book_284.txt,"December 17, 1932","To claim permanence for untouchability, as you evidently claim for it, is to indefinitely postpone realization of oneness, unless you were to postulate that that realization is to come to humanity from outside sources."

volume53_book_6.txt,"January 11, 1933","Fortunately for me, your indulgence is due to an oversight of a material condition, whose happening was to automatically postpone the fast, and this was some legal difficulty which could not be got over within the time."

volume53_book_6.txt,"January 11, 1933",1 This is how I rehearsed the whole thing to myself before I made the proposal to Pandit Panchanan Tarkaratna.

volume53_book_6.txt,"January 11, 1933","If it is found by experience that the caste Hindus who offer worship during the joint period are themselves a negligible quantity, it would be a defeat for the reformer, and it would be a sign that the Harijans should abstain from entering those temples where they are unwelcome visitors."
volume53_book_6.txt,"January 11, 1933",They would not then have to go to the temples as beggars before caste-men.
volume53_book_6.txt,"January 11, 1933","They will go, if they go at all, as fellow-Hindus, welcomed by an overwhelming majority of caste-men who would not consider themselves in any way polluted by the touch of the erstwhile untouchables."

volume53_book_6.txt,"January 11, 1933",It is an undoubted fact that-whether it is right or wrong is not the question-thousands of people attribute particular sanctity to their favourite temples.

volume53_book_6.txt,"January 11, 1933","Sanctity handed down from ancient times cannot be imparted to a new image and a new temple by the mere will of man, and therefore the proposal I have now published dawned upon me, and the proposal to be of any value 1 Gandhiji's compromise proposed to satisfy caste Hindus."

volume53_book_6.txt,"January 11, 1933","That I may fail miserably in reducing my creed to practice on all occasions does not detract from the creed, and is irrelevant to the discussion; and my non-violence would not permit me to do violence to the feelings of a single devotee who has been accustomed to visit a particular temple."
volume53_book_6.txt,"January 11, 1933","I would also ask you to remember that, whatever may be said to the contrary, for me the whole of this campaign against untouchability is a purely religious campaign."
volume53_book_6.txt,"January 11, 1933","It is a movement of a big reform in Hinduism which, as I have said so repeatedly, must die if untouchability as we know it today is not eradicated."

volume55_book_503.txt,"September 14, 1933",I have no doubt in my mind that our goal can be no less than 'Complete Independence'.
volume55_book_503.txt,"September 14, 1933",I am also in whole-hearted agreement with you when you say that without a material revision of vested interests the condition of the masses can never be improved.
volume55_book_503.txt,"September 14, 1933","I believe, too, though I may not go as far as you do, that before India can become one homogeneous entity, the princes will have to part with much of their power and become popular representatives of the people over whom they are ruling today."
volume55_book_503.txt,"September 14, 1933",I can corroborate from first-hand experience much of what you say about the Round Table Conference.
volume55_book_503.txt,"September 14, 1933","Nor have I the slightest difficulty in agreeing with you that in these days of rapid intercommunication and a growing consciousness of the oneness of all mankind, we must recognize that our nationalism must not be inconsistent with progressive internationalism."

volume55_book_503.txt,"September 14, 1933","I can, therefore, go the whole length with you and say that 'we should range ourselves with the progressive forces of the world'."
volume55_book_503.txt,"September 14, 1933","But I know that though there is such an agreement between you and me in the enunciation of ideals, there are temperamental differences between us."
volume55_book_503.txt,"September 14, 1933","Thus you have emphasized the necessity of a clear statement of the goal, but having once determined it, I have never attached importance to the repetition."
volume55_book_503.txt,"September 14, 1933",The clearest possible definition of the goal and its appreciation would fail to take us there if we do not know and utilize the means of achieving it.

volume55_book_503.txt,"September 14, 1933","I am quite clear in my mind that had those instructions not been issued, the whole movement of civil resistance would have collapsed through growing internal weakness; for Congressmen were deluding themselves into the belief that there were organizations effectively functioning to which they could look for guidance, when, as a matter of fact, under the organized terrorism which the Ordinance Rule means, organized functioning of Congress Committees had become impossible."
volume55_book_503.txt,"September 14, 1933","A false belief in the functioning of organizations, rendered illegal and largely impotent, was fast producing a demoralization which had to be arrested."
volume55_book_503.txt,"September 14, 1933",There is no such thing as demoralization in civil resistance properly applied.
volume55_book_503.txt,"September 14, 1933","You have said rightly that after all ""civil disobedience is essentially an individual affair""."
volume55_book_503.txt,"September 14, 1933","I go a step further and say that so long as there is one civil resister offering resistance, the movement cannot die and must succeed in the end."
volume55_book_503.txt,"September 14, 1933",Individual civil resisters do not need the aid of an organization.
volume55_book_503.txt,"September 14, 1933",After all an organization is nothing without the individuals composing it.
volume55_book_503.txt,"September 14, 1933","Aney's instructions were, therefore, I hold, an affective answer to the Ordinances and if only men and women belonging to the Congress will appreciate the necessity of those instructions with all their implications, the Ordinances will be rendered nugatory, at least so far as the resisters are concerned."
volume55_book_503.txt,"September 14, 1933",They can form a nucleus around which an army of invincible civil resisters can be built up.
volume55_book_503.txt,"September 14, 1933",Aney's instructions or in my note would warrant the supposition that they preclude organized action by Congressmen in any shape or form.
volume55_book_503.txt,"September 14, 1933",I would like to warn you against thinking that there is no fundamental difference between individual civil resistance and mass civil resistance.
volume55_book_503.txt,"September 14, 1933","I think that the fundamental difference is implied in your own admission that ""it is essentially an individual affair""."
volume55_book_503.txt,"September 14, 1933",The chief distinction between mass civil resistance and individual civil resistance is that in the latter everyone is a complete independent unit and his fall does not affect the others; in mass civil resistance the fall of one generally adversely affects the rest.
volume55_book_503.txt,"September 14, 1933","Again, in mass civil resistance leadership is essential, in individual civil resistance every resister is his own leader."

volume55_book_503.txt,"September 14, 1933","If Congressmen will realize that all property is liable to be confiscated at any moment, they will learn to be utterly independent of it."
volume55_book_503.txt,"September 14, 1933",I quite agree with you that it is ludicrous for individuals to send notices to the local authorities of their intention to offer a particular form of civil disobedience.

volume55_book_351.txt,"July 26, 1933",The present site for the Ashram was bought in 1916.
volume55_book_351.txt,"July 26, 1933",It conducts today certain activities mostly through the labour of inmates.
volume55_book_351.txt,"July 26, 1933",But it does need to supplement that labour with ordinary paid labour.
volume55_book_351.txt,"July 26, 1933","Its principal activities are: khadi production as a village industry without the aid of power-driven machinery, dairy, agriculture, scientific scavenging and literary education."
volume55_book_351.txt,"July 26, 1933","The Ashram has 107 inmates at present (men 42, women 31, boys 12 and girls 22)."

volume55_book_351.txt,"July 26, 1933","Most of these, so far as my knowledge goes, are doing useful constructive work and earning an honest livelihood."

volume55_book_351.txt,"July 26, 1933",The funds at its disposal are ear-marked.
volume55_book_351.txt,"July 26, 1933","Whilst the aim has been to make every department self-supporting, it has hitherto been obliged to receive donations from friends to meet all the obligations."
volume55_book_351.txt,"July 26, 1933","Experience has shown that so long as it remains a predominantly educational service (using the term in the widest sense) and not only charges no fees but actually feeds and clothes the learners, it cannot be wholly self-supporting."

volume55_book_351.txt,"July 26, 1933","3,60,000 and movables including cash estimated at over Rs."
volume55_book_351.txt,"July 26, 1933",The Ashram takes no part in politics so-called.
volume55_book_351.txt,"July 26, 1933","But it does believe in non-co-operation and civil disobedience as indispensable, under certain circumstances, for the observance of truth and non-violence."
volume55_book_351.txt,"July 26, 1933","Hence, the civil disobedience campaign of 1930 was started by the march to Dandi of nearly eighty inmates of the Ashram."
volume55_book_351.txt,"July 26, 1933",Time has now arrived for the Ashram to make a greater sacrifice in the face of the existing situation-on the one hand the growing terrorism by the Government and on the other the equally growing demoralization among the people.
volume55_book_351.txt,"July 26, 1933","The statements that have come under my observation since the breaking of my fast show that 1. methods of torture have been adopted by the police in various parts of India in order to cow down individual civil resisters, 2. women have been insulted, 3. free movement of people has become almost impossible, 4. in many parts of India, village work by Congressmen has become all but impossible, 5. civil resistance prisoners have been subjected to humiliations and bodily injury in many lock-ups and prisons, 6. unconscionably heavy fines have been imposed and gross irregularities committed for their recovery, 7. peasants withholding revenue or rent have been punished in a manner out of all proportion to their offence, obviously with a view to terrifying them and their neighbours into subjection 2 , 8. the public Press has been gagged, 9. in short, freedom with self-respect has become impossible throughout the length and breadth of the land."

volume55_book_351.txt,"July 26, 1933",But in common with many Congressmen I believe in them and therefore they are able to arouse us to action.
volume55_book_351.txt,"July 26, 1933","Hence, mere incarceration can bring little satisfaction."
volume55_book_351.txt,"July 26, 1933","Moreover, I quite clearly see that the vast constructive programme of the Ashram cannot be carried on with safety, unless the Ashram ceases entirely to have anything to do with the campaign."
volume55_book_351.txt,"July 26, 1933",To accept such a position will be to deny the creed.
volume55_book_351.txt,"July 26, 1933",Up to now I had hoped that the existence of the Ashram side by side with the civil resistance of its individual members was possible and that there was bound to be an honourable peace between Government and the Congress in the near future even though the Congress goal might not be immediately realized.
volume55_book_351.txt,"July 26, 1933","The unfortunate rejection by His Excellency the Viceroy of the honest advance of the Congress through me, in the interest of peace, shows clearly that the Government do not seek or desire peace, they want an abject surrender by the largest and the admittedly most, if not the only, popular political organization in the country."
volume55_book_351.txt,"July 26, 1933",This is impossible so long as the Congress continues to repose confidence in its present advisers.
volume55_book_351.txt,"July 26, 1933",The struggle therefore is bound to be prolonged and calls for much greater sacrifice than the people have hitherto undergone.
volume55_book_351.txt,"July 26, 1933",It follows that the greatest measure of sacrifice is to be expected of me as the author of the movement.
volume55_book_351.txt,"July 26, 1933",I can therefore only offer that which is nearest and dearest to me and for the building of which I and many other members of the Ashram have laboured with infinite patience and care all these eighteen years.

volume55_book_351.txt,"July 26, 1933",It will not be without a tear that we shall break up the family and its activities.
volume55_book_351.txt,"July 26, 1933","I have had many and prayerful conversations with the inmates and they have, men and women, unanimously approved of the proposal to give up the present activities."
volume55_book_351.txt,"July 26, 1933",Those who are at all able have decided to offer individual civil disobedience after the suspension period is over.
volume55_book_351.txt,"July 26, 1933",It may not be superfluous to mention that the Ashram has for the past two years refused to pay revenue dues and consequently goods of considerable value have been seized and sold in respect of them.
volume55_book_351.txt,"July 26, 1933",I make no complaint of the procedure.
volume55_book_351.txt,"July 26, 1933",But it cannot be a matter of pleasure or profit to carry on a great institution in such precarious circumstances.
volume55_book_351.txt,"July 26, 1933","I fully realize that whether a State is just or unjust and whether it is under popular or foreign control, the citizen's possessions may at any time be forcibly taken away from 304 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI him by the State, if he comes in conflict with it."
volume55_book_351.txt,"July 26, 1933","In the circumstances, it seems to me to be simple prudence to anticipate the inevitable in a conflict which promises to be indefinitely prolonged."
volume55_book_351.txt,"July 26, 1933",But whilst it has been decided to break up the Ashram we want everything to be used for public purpose.
volume55_book_351.txt,"July 26, 1933","Therefore, unless the Government for any reason desire to take charge of any or all of the movables including cash, I propose to hand them over to those friends who will take them and use them for public benefit and in accordance with the earmarking."
volume55_book_351.txt,"July 26, 1933",Thus the khadi stock and contents of the workshop and the weaving sheds will be handed over to the All-India Spinners' Association on whose behalf that activity has been carried on.

volume55_book_351.txt,"July 26, 1933",The library will be handed probably to an institution that will take care of it.
volume55_book_351.txt,"July 26, 1933",The moneys and articles belonging to the various parties will be returned [to] them or kept for them by friends who will care to take charge of them.
volume55_book_351.txt,"July 26, 1933","Then there remain the land, the buildings and the crops."
volume55_book_351.txt,"July 26, 1933",I suggest that the Government take possession of these and do what they like with them.
volume55_book_351.txt,"July 26, 1933",I would gladly have handed these also to friends but I cannot be party to their paying the revenue dues.
volume55_book_351.txt,"July 26, 1933",And naturally I may not hand them to fellow resisters.
volume55_book_351.txt,"July 26, 1933","All, therefore, I wish is that beneficial use be made of the land, buildings and the valuable trees and crops instead of being allowed to run to waste as I see has been done in many cases."
volume55_book_351.txt,"July 26, 1933",There is a plot of land with buildings occupied by Harijan families.
volume55_book_351.txt,"July 26, 1933",They have hitherto paid no rent.
volume55_book_351.txt,"July 26, 1933",I have no desire to invite them to take part in civil resistance.
volume55_book_351.txt,"July 26, 1933",They will now pay the nominal rent of one rupee per year to the trustees of the Ashram and be responsible for the revenue due on that portion.
volume55_book_351.txt,"July 26, 1933","If for any reason, the Government decline to take possession of the property mentioned, the Ashram will still be vacated by the inmates as soon as may be after the expiry of the suspension period, viz., 31st instant unless the date is anticipated by the Government."
volume55_book_351.txt,"July 26, 1933","I request a telegraphic reply to this letter, at least, in so far as the Government's wishes regarding the movables are concerned so as to enable me to remove them in due time if I am to remove them at all."
volume53_book_392.txt,"February 13, 1933","LETTER TO HINDU CENTRAL COMMITTEE February 13, 1933 DEAR FRIENDS, 1."
volume53_book_392.txt,"February 13, 1933",In continuation of my letter acknowledging yours of 4th instant I have now to say that I have read the statement of the Hindu Central Committee with much attention and when after reading the statement I saw the names of distinguished lawyers amongst other notabilities as the original members of the Committee I was filled with sorrow.
volume53_book_392.txt,"February 13, 1933","Take this assertion in the statement: We feel that there is no question of inferiority complex in the divisions of Hindu society and least of all, no sin has been committed all these centuries by the orthodox Hindus who have been following the traditions established by all the merciful humanitarian sages of this land."
volume53_book_392.txt,"February 13, 1933",Is this assertion borne out by the evidence of the senses?
volume53_book_392.txt,"February 13, 1933",If the Committee were to contend that there is in the Hindu Shastras no inferiority or superiority I should at once agree.
volume53_book_392.txt,"February 13, 1933",But 292 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI untouchability as it is practised today with the attendant system of locations and deprivation practically of all the amenities of life for the so-called untouchables is surely proof of their inferiority.
volume53_book_392.txt,"February 13, 1933",These disabilities have been often enumerated in the public Press.
volume53_book_392.txt,"February 13, 1933",The precept of equality therefore seems to have been systematically and cruelly disregarded by modern Hindu society.
volume53_book_392.txt,"February 13, 1933",Is the Committee able to point out any act on the part of what it calls the orthodox Hindus for the amelioration of the economic and material condition of the depressed classes?
volume53_book_392.txt,"February 13, 1933","And is not the very existence of a class called ""depressed"" sufficient contradiction of the above-quoted assertion?"
volume53_book_392.txt,"February 13, 1933",The Committee then proceeds and says: There are also in many places in the country large sections of the population amongst caste Hindus who are worse than Panchamas both economically and culturally.
volume53_book_392.txt,"February 13, 1933","I am unaware of any sections of caste Hindus who are both economically and culturally worse than Panchamas, and if there are I should very much like to know their names."
volume53_book_392.txt,"February 13, 1933",The third statement of the Committee to which I would invite attention is: It will be a travesty of truth to suggest that the orthodox Hindus have not been generous in their dealings with the Panchamas or Harijans in the villages.
volume53_book_392.txt,"February 13, 1933","Is it a sign of generosity on the part of caste Hindus to give leavings of their dishes to Harijans, to force their labour against a starvation wage, to deny to them the services of physicians, schoolmasters, barbers and practically all the other services to which they, the caste Hindus, are used?"
volume53_book_392.txt,"February 13, 1933","Another statement of the Committee is: Except in the higher classes today, there is no unemployment problem in the country."
volume53_book_392.txt,"February 13, 1933","Surely, this is a sweeping statement at complete variance with known facts as found in historical and Government records."
volume53_book_392.txt,"February 13, 1933",The Committee then proceeds: The first creed of the orthodox Hindu is always the gift of food to the hungry and he has always felt it as a religious duty and his first prayer has been to the Lord to vouchsafe happiness to all human beings.
volume53_book_392.txt,"February 13, 1933",The creed is undoubtedly there.
volume53_book_392.txt,"February 13, 1933",Has the Committee any evidence to show any corresponding action on the part of the orthodox Hindus in connection with Harijans?
volume53_book_392.txt,"February 13, 1933",LETTER TO HINDU CENTRAL COMMITTEE 293 7.
volume53_book_392.txt,"February 13, 1933","Then the Committee goes on to say: It cannot be suggested for one moment that though the Congress has thrown itself whole-heartedly in favour of this agitation for the removal of untouchability and for temple-entry after the announcement of the fast of Mr. Gandhi, it has done any appreciable service for the economic and material uplift of the depressed classes."
volume53_book_392.txt,"February 13, 1933","The Committee should know that it is not possible for the Congress ""to throw itself whole-heartedly into the agitation""."
volume53_book_392.txt,"February 13, 1933",It is being carried on by the general Hindu population organized by the recently formed Servants of Untouchables Society.
volume53_book_392.txt,"February 13, 1933",That Society invites all without distinction of party to help it to remove untouchability.
volume53_book_392.txt,"February 13, 1933",This Society has planned a wide constructive programme.
volume53_book_392.txt,"February 13, 1933","In so far as the Congress itself is concerned, its Hindu members have a record for the service of Harijans which is second to that of no other similar organization."
volume53_book_392.txt,"February 13, 1933","But the Committee goes on: If the call to join the movement for such uplift comes from persons who are pledged to temple-entry, the orthodox Hindus on their part cannot but view it with suspicion, especially when it is preceded by Gandhi's cry of ""Leave the temple-entry to me""."
volume53_book_392.txt,"February 13, 1933","I fail to see why the orthodox Hindus should view with suspicion the call for joining the movement for uplift because it comes from persons who are openly advocating temple-entry, not by compulsion but by conversion."
volume53_book_392.txt,"February 13, 1933","And what can be the meaning of emphasis on my statement ""Leave the temple-entry to me""?"
volume53_book_392.txt,"February 13, 1933","I am charitable enough to assume that the Committee framed that sentence without knowing the context in which ""Leave the temple-entry to me"" was first used."
volume53_book_392.txt,"February 13, 1933",It was said in answer to correspondents who were impatient to offer satyagraha and adopt energetic measures for opening other temples.
volume53_book_392.txt,"February 13, 1933",In order to keep the movement within fixed limits and in order to confine direct action by way of fast for the present at least to Sjt.
volume53_book_392.txt,"February 13, 1933","Kelappan and myself I said to the correspondents, ""Leave the templeentry to me and go on with the other constructive programme of economic and educational uplift""."
volume53_book_392.txt,"February 13, 1933",The Committee can easily verify this from my writings.
volume53_book_392.txt,"February 13, 1933",I hope therefore that the Committee will disabuse their minds of the prejudice betrayed against me in the sentence quoted.
volume53_book_392.txt,"February 13, 1933","The next sentence in the Committee's statement runs: If Mr. Gandhi and his followers will give an undertaking to save temples and other religious institutions from interference by the mixed legislatures of the land, we are willing to whole-heartedly co-operate with them."
volume53_book_392.txt,"February 13, 1933",294 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI I have shown repeatedly that the two Bills before the Legislative Assembly imply no interference with temples or other religious institutions.
volume53_book_392.txt,"February 13, 1933","They seek to restore the status quo existing before certain decisions of law-courts, well known to the legal members of the Committee."
volume53_book_392.txt,"February 13, 1933","I can give the assurance on my behalf and on behalf of my co-workers that we have no desire whatsoever to invoke interference by the legislatures in matters of religion and if only the Committee will co-operate in the prosecution of the general movement for the removal of untouchability, not of the desirable type such as is mentioned in the Shastras in the interests of sanitation, but of the-in my opinion-undesirable type as is being practised today, the Committee will soon discover that there is no cause whatsoever for alarm or suspicion and that if there is anything in the two Bills that can be shown to be an interference with religious liberty, the defect can undoubtedly be remedied without difficulty."
volume53_book_392.txt,"February 13, 1933","With the sentiment expressed in the last two sentences of the statement of the Committee I can whole-heartedly agree, for so far as I am concerned there is no desire indiscriminately ""to import Western ideals of society, civilization and equality""."
volume53_book_392.txt,"February 13, 1933","Perhaps, no one has written, and endeavoured as much as possible to act in accordance with the writing, against Western civilization and I have not the slightest desire to destroy the foundations of Hindu caste system, if by that is meant varnashramadharma."
volume53_book_392.txt,"February 13, 1933","The movement against untouchability is on that very account deliberately circumscribed and restricted to the very things described by the Committee except temple-entry, and as to this last, it can be shown conclusively that there is no desire whatsoever to force temple-entry but by proper disciplined agitation to bring about a change in Hindu public opinion, a change not inconsistent with the spirit of the Shastras."
volume53_book_392.txt,"February 13, 1933","If the Committee will dispassionately read my analysis of the statement, I am not without hope that it will see that whoever has framed the statement has committed the members of the Committee to assertions which cannot be supported by existing facts."
volume53_book_392.txt,"February 13, 1933","The statement though sent to me is merely a copy of what has already been sent to the Press, but on reading the statement I discovered that according to the Committee's admissions there was a great deal that was common between the Committee and the reformers and that the assertions which were made in order to emphasize differences were mostly if not wholly imaginary and not capable of proof."
volume53_book_392.txt,"February 13, 1933",I felt that I would point out to the Committee in a private communication the glaring flaws in the statement LETTER TO RAMJI 295 and see if there was not any possibility of meeting on a common platform.
volume53_book_392.txt,"February 13, 1933","If the Committee however considers that all the assertions made in the statement can be supported and that I am labouring under self-delusion, I would be glad to be corrected."
volume53_book_392.txt,"February 13, 1933","If the Committee sees any good in my letter, I invite it to send one or more representatives to confer with me with a view to exploring possibilities of common action or at least of understanding the real differences in matters of principle."

volume57_book_259.txt,"March 6, 1934","Maclean of Wilson College, Bombay—had thought that although the matter was stale, it was worth while my clearing it up, as the denial by the Rome journalist had created a profound impression at the time of its publication and had probably precipitated the Viceregal action against me in 1932."
volume57_book_259.txt,"March 6, 1934","Agreeing with Prof. Maclean, I at once asked Mirabai to write to Miss Agatha Harrison to procure the relevant newspaper cuttings."
volume57_book_259.txt,"March 6, 1934",After much search she was able to get them.
volume57_book_259.txt,"March 6, 1934",The last and the most important I received from her last month in the midst of my hurricane tour in the cause of the anti-untouchability campaign.

volume57_book_259.txt,"March 6, 1934",It should be noted that these cuttings were for the first time seen by me on their being received from Miss Harrison.
volume57_book_259.txt,"March 6, 1934","I have now read and reread them several times, and I have no hesitation in saying that 'A' and 'C' are a caricature of what took place."

volume57_book_259.txt,"March 6, 1934","In 'C' The Times correspondent, on seeing my denial regarding the alleged interview, makes a halting admission that I might be correct in so far as Signor Gayda did not ""request any formal interview and no such interview was granted,"" but insists that the statements attributed to me were substantially correct."
volume57_book_259.txt,"March 6, 1934",But truth will perhaps be better served by my simply stating what I do know than by analysing 'A' and 'C'.

volume57_book_259.txt,"March 6, 1934",At this meeting I was introduced to several friends whose names I cannot now recall and could not have recalled even the day after the meeting.

volume57_book_259.txt,"March 6, 1934","At this meeting the conversation was general, and not addressed to any particular individual."
volume57_book_259.txt,"March 6, 1934",Questions were put by several friends and there was a random conversation as at all drawing-room meetings.
volume57_book_259.txt,"March 6, 1934",It was therefore wrong for Signor Gayda or The Times correspondent to reproduce my remarks as if they were one connected statement to one particular person.
volume57_book_259.txt,"March 6, 1934",Signor Gayda never showed to me for verification anything he might have taken down.
volume57_book_259.txt,"March 6, 1934","The conversation, among other things, referred to the Round Table Conference, my impression of it and my possible future action."
volume57_book_259.txt,"March 6, 1934",Many of the things that have been put into my mouth in 'A' I had never said.
volume57_book_259.txt,"March 6, 1934","All my hopes, fears and future intentions were expressed in as precise a language as it was possible for me to command and use in my speech at the close of the Round Table Conference."
volume57_book_259.txt,"March 6, 1934",Whatever I said in private conversation was but a paraphrase of the sentiments expressed in that speech.

volume58_book_447.txt,"September 5, 1934","LETTER TO VALLABHBHAI PATEL [Before] September [5], 1934 1 DEAR VALLABHBHAI, After much deliberation and discussions with friends who have been to Wardha recently, I have come to the conclusion that the best interests of the Congress and the nation will be served by my completely severing all official or physical connection with the Congress, including the original membership."
volume58_book_447.txt,"September 5, 1934",This does not mean that I cease to take any interest in an organization with which I have been intimately connected since 1920 and which I have worshipped since my youth.
volume58_book_447.txt,"September 5, 1934","In spite of all I have recently said about the corruption that has crept into the organization, 1 Gandhiji had been having discussions on his withdrawal from active leadership of the Congress; vide the following item."

volume58_book_447.txt,"September 5, 1934","404 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI it still remains, in my opinion, the most powerful and the most representative national organization in the country."
volume58_book_447.txt,"September 5, 1934",It has a history of uninterrupted noble service and sacrifice from its inception.
volume58_book_447.txt,"September 5, 1934",Its progress has been unbroken and steady.
volume58_book_447.txt,"September 5, 1934",It has weathered storms as no other institution in the country has.
volume58_book_447.txt,"September 5, 1934",It has commanded the largest measure of sacrifice of which any country would be proud.
volume58_book_447.txt,"September 5, 1934",It has today the largest number of selfsacrificing men and women of unimpeachable character.
volume58_book_447.txt,"September 5, 1934",It is not with a light heart that I leave this great organization.
volume58_book_447.txt,"September 5, 1934",But I feel that my remaining in it any longer is likely to do more harm than good.
volume58_book_447.txt,"September 5, 1934",I miss at this juncture the association and advice of Jawaharlal who is bound to be the rightful helmsman of the organization in the near future.
volume58_book_447.txt,"September 5, 1934","I have, therefore, kept before me his great spirit."
volume58_book_447.txt,"September 5, 1934","And I feel that whilst his great affection for me would want to keep me in the Congress, his reason would endorse the step I have taken."
volume58_book_447.txt,"September 5, 1934","And since a great organization cannot be governed by affections but by cold reason, it is better for me to retire from a field where my presence results in arresting full play of reason."
volume58_book_447.txt,"September 5, 1934",Hence in leaving the organization I feel that I am in no sense deserting one who is much more than a comrade and whom no amount of political differences will ever separate from me.
volume58_book_447.txt,"September 5, 1934","Nor by retiring at this critical juncture am I less true to Babu Rajendra Prasad who will in all probability be the President of the forthcoming Congress, and who unlike Jawaharlal shares most of my ideals and whose sacrifice for the nation, judged whether in quality or quantity, is not to be excelled."
volume58_book_447.txt,"September 5, 1934","Then there is the Congress Parliamentary Board which would perhaps not have come into being, unless I had encouraged its formation with my whole heart."
volume58_book_447.txt,"September 5, 1934",It supplies a want that was felt by many staunch and true Congressmen.
volume58_book_447.txt,"September 5, 1934","It was necessary, therefore, to bring it into being."
volume58_book_447.txt,"September 5, 1934",Such services as I am capable of rendering will still be at its disposal as at any Congressman's.
volume58_book_447.txt,"September 5, 1934",It must command the full support of all Congressmen who have no insuperable objection to the entry of Congressmen into the existing legislatures.
volume58_book_447.txt,"September 5, 1934",I should be sorry if the Board lost a single vote because of my withdrawal.
volume58_book_447.txt,"September 5, 1934","I fear none of the consequences dreaded by some friends, for I know my ground."
volume58_book_447.txt,"September 5, 1934",A tree is no more hurt by a ripe fruit falling from it than would the Congress be by my going out of it.
volume58_book_447.txt,"September 5, 1934","Indeed the fruit will be dead weight, if it did not fall when it was fully ripe."
volume58_book_447.txt,"September 5, 1934",Mine is that condition.
volume58_book_447.txt,"September 5, 1934",I feel that I am a dead weight on the Congress now.
volume58_book_447.txt,"September 5, 1934",LETTER TO VALLABHBHAI PATEL 405 There is a growing and vital difference of outlook between many Congressmen and myself.
volume58_book_447.txt,"September 5, 1934",My presence more and more estranges the intelligentsia from the Congress.
volume58_book_447.txt,"September 5, 1934","I feel that my policies fail to convince their reason, though strange as it may appear, I do nothing that does not satisfy my own reason."
volume58_book_447.txt,"September 5, 1934","But my reason takes me in a direction just the opposite of what many of the most intellectual Congressmen would gladly and enthusiastically take, if they were not hampered by their unexampled loyalty to me."
volume58_book_447.txt,"September 5, 1934",No leader can expect greater loyalty and devotion than I have received from intellectually-minded Congressmen even when they have protested and signified their disapproval of the policies I have laid before the Congress.
volume58_book_447.txt,"September 5, 1934",I feel that for me any more to draw upon this loyalty and devotion is to put an undue strain upon them.
volume58_book_447.txt,"September 5, 1934",I wish that those who strongly disapprove of my method would outvote me and compel my retirement.
volume58_book_447.txt,"September 5, 1934",I have tried to reach that position but I have failed.
volume58_book_447.txt,"September 5, 1934",They would cling to me till the end.
volume58_book_447.txt,"September 5, 1934",The only way I can requite such loyalty is by voluntary retirement.
volume58_book_447.txt,"September 5, 1934",I cannot work in opposition when there are some fundamental differences between the Congress intelligentsia and me.
volume58_book_447.txt,"September 5, 1934",Ever since my entry into public life I have never acted in that manner.
volume58_book_447.txt,"September 5, 1934",1 Then there is the growing group of socialists.
volume58_book_447.txt,"September 5, 1934",Jawaharlal is their undisputed leader.
volume58_book_447.txt,"September 5, 1934",I know pretty well what he wants and stands for.
volume58_book_447.txt,"September 5, 1934",He claims to examine everything in a scientific spirit.
volume58_book_447.txt,"September 5, 1934",He is courage personified.
volume58_book_447.txt,"September 5, 1934",He has many years of service in front of him.
volume58_book_447.txt,"September 5, 1934",He has an indomitable faith in his mission.
volume58_book_447.txt,"September 5, 1934","The socialist group represents his views more or less, though probably their mode of execution is not exactly his."
volume58_book_447.txt,"September 5, 1934",That group is bound to grow in influence and importance.
volume58_book_447.txt,"September 5, 1934",I have welcomed the group.
volume58_book_447.txt,"September 5, 1934",Many of them are respected and self-sacrificing co-workers.
volume58_book_447.txt,"September 5, 1934","With all this, I have fundamental differences with them on the programme published in their authorized pamphlets."
volume58_book_447.txt,"September 5, 1934","But I would not, by reason of the moral pressure I may be able to exert, suppress the spread of the ideas propounded in their literature."
volume58_book_447.txt,"September 5, 1934",My remaining in the Congress would amount to the exercise of such pressure.
volume58_book_447.txt,"September 5, 1934","I may not interfere with free expression of those ideas, however distasteful some of them may be to me."
volume58_book_447.txt,"September 5, 1934",.2 For me to dominate the Congress in spite of these fundamental differences is almost a species of violence which I must refrain from.
volume58_book_447.txt,"September 5, 1934",Their reason must be set free at any cost.
volume58_book_447.txt,"September 5, 1934","Having discovered this undisputable fact, I would be disloyal to the Congress if, even at the risk of losing all my reputation, I did not leave the Congress."
volume58_book_447.txt,"September 5, 1934","1 & 2 Omissions as in the source 406 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI But there is no danger to my reputation or that of the Congress, if I leave only to serve it better in thought, word and deed."
volume58_book_447.txt,"September 5, 1934","I do not leave in anger or in a huff, nor yet in disappointment."
volume58_book_447.txt,"September 5, 1934",I have no disappointment in me.
volume58_book_447.txt,"September 5, 1934",I see before me a bright future for the country.
volume58_book_447.txt,"September 5, 1934","Everything will go well, if we are true to ourselves."
volume58_book_447.txt,"September 5, 1934",I have no other programme before me save the Congress programme now before the country .
volume58_book_447.txt,"September 5, 1934",1 In this and various other ways I would love to serve the Congress in my own humble manner.
volume58_book_447.txt,"September 5, 1934","Thus living in complete detachment, I hope, I shall come closer to the Congress."
volume58_book_447.txt,"September 5, 1934",Congressmen will then accept my services without being embarrassed or oppressed.
volume58_book_447.txt,"September 5, 1934","One word to those who have given me their whole-hearted devotion in thought, word and deed in the pursuit of the common goal."
volume58_book_447.txt,"September 5, 1934",My physical withdrawal from the Congress is not to be understood to mean an invitation to them to withdraw.
volume58_book_447.txt,"September 5, 1934",They will remain in the Congress fold so long as the Congress needs them and work out such common ideals as they have assimilated.
volume56_book_502.txt,"January 15, 1934","LETTER TO VALLABHBHAI PATEL January 15, 1934 BHAI VALLABHBHAI, It is four in the afternoon just now."

volume56_book_502.txt,"January 15, 1934",Thakkar Bapa and Shankerlal will arrive tomorrow.
volume56_book_502.txt,"January 15, 1934",I will see the Zamorin 4 tomorrow at 2.30 in the afternoon and then will leave for Trichur at five.
volume56_book_502.txt,"January 15, 1934",The question is whether Lakshmi should go to Delhi for her delivery or remain in Madras.
volume56_book_502.txt,"January 15, 1934",She and Devdas will see Raja in about two days.
volume56_book_502.txt,"January 15, 1934",They will come to a final decision after that.
volume56_book_502.txt,"January 15, 1934","Devdas has got the permission to go to Delhi, but I think he should spend about six months in Madras to gain experience."
volume56_book_502.txt,"January 15, 1934",Lakshmi would not like her delivery to take place in his absence and Raja would not like it in his.
volume56_book_502.txt,"January 15, 1934",Thus there is a problem within a problem.
volume56_book_502.txt,"January 15, 1934",Doesn't the meaning of life consist in solving even such seemingly trivial problems in the right manner?
volume56_book_502.txt,"January 15, 1934",I have specially called Shankerlal here for a brief discussion regarding khadi.
volume56_book_502.txt,"January 15, 1934",I observe that perhaps needless expenditure is being incurred in our department.
volume56_book_502.txt,"January 15, 1934",I wish to place before him what I have observed.
volume56_book_502.txt,"January 15, 1934",I think we should stop the needless expenditure on sending khadi from one province to another.

volume56_book_502.txt,"January 15, 1934",The practice followed at Saoli also seems good.
volume56_book_502.txt,"January 15, 1934",Krishnadas [Gandhi] and Jajuji are experts and they complement each other perfectly.
volume56_book_502.txt,"January 15, 1934",Krishnadas is acquitting himself very well.
volume56_book_502.txt,"January 15, 1934",Ramdas is discontented.
volume56_book_502.txt,"January 15, 1934",He also will become calm by and by.
volume56_book_502.txt,"January 15, 1934",He is full of praise for her courage.
volume56_book_502.txt,"January 15, 1934",She is of course harassed a little.
volume56_book_502.txt,"January 15, 1934",But without harassment there would be no pleasure in being in jail.
volume56_book_502.txt,"January 15, 1934",I paid a visit to Guruvayur.

volume56_book_502.txt,"January 15, 1934","They got hold of a man by his feet, whereupon the young men there asked them to get down."
volume56_book_502.txt,"January 15, 1934",An altercation and fighting followed.
volume56_book_502.txt,"January 15, 1934",The pahelwans got beaten up a little.
volume56_book_502.txt,"January 15, 1934","They are quite all right, but they did their play-acting cleverly."
volume56_book_502.txt,"January 15, 1934",I sent the two to a dispensary and started the meeting and went on with it as if nothing had happened.

volume60_book_59.txt,"January 3, 1935","In my opinion, if the withdrawal comes even at the last moment, it will be a blessing both for England and India, for the simple reason that persistence in the measure in the face of an almost unanimous Indian opposition to it would mean an unbending attitude on the part of the British Parliament and utter contempt for Indian public opinion."

volume60_book_59.txt,"January 3, 1935","The contemptuous dismissal of that Memorandum, beyond a mere courteous reference to it, has extorted the following remark from Sastri: No, Sir, it is impossible for the Liberal Party to give an atom of cooperation."

volume60_book_59.txt,"January 3, 1935",I should call it a suicide.
volume60_book_59.txt,"January 3, 1935",There is no suggestion in the J. P. C. Report that there should be a clause In the constitution providing for automatic advance to complete independence or whatever the elected representatives of India may decide to have.
volume60_book_59.txt,"January 3, 1935",The contemplated constitution saddles India with a greater financial burden than she is bearing today without any prospect of economic or political betterment.

volume60_book_59.txt,"January 3, 1935","The provincial autonomy adumbrated in the Report is purely nominal, as the Governors of the provinces have such wide powers that they can, whenever they choose, make an end of responsibility."
volume60_book_59.txt,"January 3, 1935","It would be utterly wrong for any Britisher to infer from Colonial precedents that these powers will be rarely, if ever, exercised."

volume60_book_59.txt,"January 3, 1935","And what is more, if the threatened new constitution is passed, it would be most difficult for years to come to undo the mischief that will be done under it."
volume60_book_59.txt,"January 3, 1935","To clinch the whole of the objections, it is well to remember that the constitution is sought to be imposed upon the people who are already groaning under repression, such as, perhaps, has not been equalled in British Indian history."
