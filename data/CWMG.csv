"1930, May 4","LETTER TO VICEROY [May 4, 1930]1 DEAR FRIEND, God willing, It is my intention on .",0,,
"1930, May 4",to set out for Dharasana and reach there with my companions on .,0,,
"1930, May 4",and demand possession of the Salt Works.,0,,
"1930, May 4",The public have been told that Dharasana is private property.,1,fact,0
"1930, May 4",This is mere camouflage.,0,,
"1930, May 4",It is as effectively under Government control as the Viceroy's House.,1,fact,0
"1930, May 4",Not a pinch of salt can be removed without the previous sanction of the authorities.,1,fact,0
"1930, May 4","It is possible for you to prevent this raid, as it has been playfully and mischievously called, in three ways: 1. by removing the salt tax; 1 The letter was drafted on the eve of Gandhiji's arrest.",1,demand,1
"1930, May 4",He was arrested at 12.45 a.m. on May 5.,1,event,1
"1930, May 4","390 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 2. by arresting me and my party unless the country can, as I hope it will, replace everyone taken away; 3. by sheer goondaism unless every head broken is replaced, as I hope it will.",1,fact,1
"1930, May 4",It is not without hesitation that the step has been decided upon.,0,,
"1930, May 4",I had hoped that the Government would fight the civil resisters in a civilized manner.,0,,
"1930, May 4",I could have had nothing to say if in dealing with the civil resisters the Government had satisfied itself with applying the ordinary processes of law.,1,fact,9000
"1930, May 4","Instead, whilst the known leaders have been dealt with more or less according to the legal formality, the rank and file has been often savagely and in some cases even indecently assaulted.",1,fact,9000
"1930, May 4","Had these been isolated cases, they might have been overlooked.",0,,
"1930, May 4","But accounts have come to me from Bengal, Bihar, Utkal, U.P., Delhi and Bombay confirming the experiences of Gujarat of which I have ample evidence at my disposal.",1,event,41
"1930, May 4","In Karachi, Peshawar and Madras the firing would appear to have been unprovoked and unnecessary.",1,fact,41
"1930, May 4","Bones have been broken, private parts have been squeezed for the purpose of making volunteers give up, to the Government valueless, to the volunteers precious salt.",1,event,41
"1930, May 4",At Mathura an Assistant Magistrate is said to have snatched the national flag from a ten-yearold boy.,1,demand,2
"1930, May 4",The crowd that demanded restoration of the flag thus illegally seized is reported to have been mercilessly beaten back.,1,event,2
"1930, May 4",That the flag was subsequently restored betrayed a guilty conscience.,1,event,2
"1930, May 4","In Bengal there seem to have been only a few prosecutions and assaults about salt, but unthinkable cruelties are said to have been practised in the act of snatching flags from volunteers.",1,fact,2
"1930, May 4","Paddy fields are reported to have been burnt, eatables forcibly taken.",1,event,9001
"1930, May 4",A vegetable market in Gujarat has been raided because the dealers would not sell vegetables to officials.,1,event,9001
"1930, May 4","These acts have taken place in front of crowds who, for the sake of Congress mandate have submitted without retaliation.",0,,
"1930, May 4",I ask you to believe the accounts given by men pledged to truth.,0,,
"1930, May 4","Repudiation even by high officials has, as in the Bardoli case, often proved false.",0,,
"1930, May 4","The officials, I regret to have to say, have not hesitated to publish falsehoods to the people even during the last five weeks.",0,,
"1930, May 4",I take the following samples from Government notices issued from Collectors' offices in Gujarat: 1.,0,,
"1930, May 4","Adults use five pounds of salt per year, therefore pay three annas per year as tax .",1,demand,9002
"1930, May 4",If Government removed the monopoly people will have to pay higher prices and in addition make good to the Government the loss sustained by the removal of the monopoly.,1,demand,9002
"1930, May 4","The salt you take from the seashore is not eatable, therefore the Government destroys it.",1,fact,9002
"1930, May 4",LETTER TO VICEROY 391 2.,0,,
"1930, May 4","Mr. Gandhi says that Government has destroyed hand-spinning in this country, whereas everybody knows that this is not true, because throughout the country, there is not a village where hand-spinning of cotton is not going on.",1,event,48
"1930, May 4",Moreover in every province cotton spinners are shown superior methods and are provided with better instruments at less price and are thus helped by Government.,0,,
"1930, May 4",Out of every five rupees of the debt that the Government has incurred rupees four have been beneficially spent.,1,fact,48
"1930, May 4",I have taken these three sets of statements from three different leaflets.,0,,
"1930, May 4",I venture to suggest that everyone of these statements is demonstrably false.,0,,
"1930, May 4",The daily consumption of salt by an adult is three times the amount stated and therefore the poll tax that the salt tax undoubtedly is is at least 9 annas per head per year.,1,fact,9003
"1930, May 4","And this tax is levied from man, woman, child and domestic cattle irrespective of age and health.",1,fact,9003
"1930, May 4","It is a wicked falsehood to say that every village has a spinning-wheel, and that the spinning movement is in any shape or form encouraged or supported by the Government.",,,
"1930, May 4",Financiers can better dispose of the falsehood that four out of every five rupees of the public debt is used for the benefit of the public.,1,fact,48
"1930, May 4",But those falsehoods are mere samples of what people know is going on in everyday contact with the Government.,0,,
"1930, May 4","Only the other day a Gujarati poet, a brave man, was convicted on perjured official evidence in spite of his emphatic statement that at the time mentioned he was sleeping soundly in another place.",0,,
"1930, May 4",Now for instances of official inactivities.,0,,
"1930, May 4",Liquor dealers have assaulted pickets admitted by officials to have been peaceful and sold liquor in contravention of regulations.,0,,
"1930, May 4",The officials have taken no notice either of the assaults or the illegal sales of liquor.,0,,
"1930, May 4","As to the assaults, though they are known to everybody, they may take shelter under the plea that they have received no complaints.",0,,
"1930, May 4",And now you have sprung upon the country a Press Ordinance surpassing any hitherto known in India.,0,,
"1930, May 4",You have found a short cut through the law's delay in the matter of the trial of Bhagat Singh and others by doing away with the ordinary procedure.,0,,
"1930, May 4",Is it any wonder if I call all these official activities and inactivities a veiled form of Martial Law?,0,,
"1930, May 4",Yet this is only the fifth week of the struggle!,0,,
"1930, May 4","Before, then, the reign of terrorism that has just begun overwhelms India, I feel that I must take a bolder step, and if possible divert your wrath in a cleaner if more drastic channel.",0,,
"1930, May 4",You may not know the things that I have described.,0,,
"1930, May 4",You may not even now believe in them.,0,,
"1930, May 4",I can but invite your serious attention to them.,0,,
"1930, May 4","392 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI Anyway I feel that it would be cowardly on my part not to invite you to disclose to the full the leonine paws of authority so that the people who are suffering tortures and destruction of their property may not feel that I, who had perhaps been the chief party inspiring them to action that has brought to light the Government in its true colours, had left any stone unturned to work out the satyagraha programme as fully as it was possible under given circumstances.",0,,
"1930, May 4","For, according to the science of satyagraha, the greater the repression and lawlessness on the part of authority, the greater should be the suffering courted by the victims.",0,,
"1930, May 4","Success is the certain result of suffering of the extremest character, voluntarily undergone.",0,,
"1930, May 4",I know the dangers attendant upon the methods adopted by me.,0,,
"1930, May 4",But the country is not likely to mistake my meaning.,0,,
"1930, May 4",I say what I mean and think.,0,,
"1930, May 4",And I have been saying for the last fifteen years in India and outside for twenty years more and repeat now that the only way to conquer violence is through non-violence pure and undefiled.,1,fact,52
"1930, May 4","I have said also that every violent act, word and even thought interferes with the progress of non-violent action.",1,fact,52
"1930, May 4","If in spite of such repeated warnings people will resort to violence, I must disown responsibility save such as inevitably attaches to every human being for the acts of every other human being.",1,demand,52
"1930, May 4","But the question of responsibility apart, I dare not postpone action on any cause whatsoever, if non-violence is the force the seers of the world have claimed it to be and if I am not to belie my own extensive experience of its working.",0,,
"1930, May 4",But I would fain avoid the further step.,0,,
"1930, May 4","I would therefore ask you to remove the tax which many of your illustrious countrymen have condemned in unmeasured terms and which, as you could not have failed to observe, has evoked universal protest and resentment expressed in civil disobedience.",,,
"1930, May 4",You may condemn civil disobedience as much as you like.,0,,
"1930, May 4",Will you prefer violent revolt to civil disobedience?,0,,
"1930, May 4","If you say, as you have said, that the civil disobedience must end in violence, history will pronounce the verdict that the British Government, not bearing because not understanding non-violence, goaded human nature to violence which it could understand and deal with.",1,fact,5
"1930, May 4",But in spite of the goading I shall hope that God will give the people of India wisdom and strength to withstand every temptation and provocation to violence.,0,,0
"1930, May 4","If, therefore, you cannot see your way to remove the salt tax, and remove the prohibition on private salt-making, I must reluctLETTER TO DR. SYED MAHMUD 393 antly commence the march adumbrated in the opening paragraph of my letter.",0,,
"1930, May 4","I am, Your sincere friend, M. K. GANDHI Young India, 8-5-1930",0,,
"1930, August 15","LETTER TO T. B. SAPRU AND M. R. JAYAKAR1 YERAVDA CENTRAL PRISON, August 15, 1930 DEAR FRIENDS, We are deeply grateful to you for having undertaken the duty of trying to effect a peaceful settlement between the British Government and the Congress.",0,,
"1930, August 15","After having perused the correspondence between yourselves and His Excellency the Viceroy and having had the benefit of protracted talks with you and having discussed among ourselves, we have come to the conclusion that the time is not yet ripe for securing a settlement honourable for our country.",0,,
"1930, August 15","Marvellous as has been the mass awakening during 1 A joint interview took place in the Yeravda Jail on August 14 and 15 between Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru and M. R. Jayakar on the one hand and Gandhiji, Motilal Nehru, Jawaharlal Nehru, Vallabhbhai Patel, Dr. Syed Mahmud, Jairamdas Doulatram and Sarojini Naidu on the other.",1,event,6
"1930, August 15",After the discussions this letter was given to Sapru and Jayakar with permission to show it to the Viceroy.,0,,
"1930, August 15","For Sapru and Jayakar's reply, vide Appendix II.",0,,
"1930, August 15","44-6 82 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI the past five months and great as has been the sufferings of the people among all grades and classes representing the different creeds, we feel that the sufferings have been neither sustained enough nor large enough for the immediate attainment of the end.",1,fact,6
"1930, August 15",Needless to mention we do not in any way share your view or the Viceroy's that civil disobedience has harmed the country or that it is ill-timed or unconstitutional.,1,fact,6
"1930, August 15",English history teems with instances of bloody revolts whose praises Englishmen have sung unstintingly and taught us to do likewise.,1,fact,6
"1930, August 15","It therefore ill becomes the Viceroy or any intelligent Englishman to condemn a revolt that is in intention and that has overwhelmingly remained in execution peaceful, but we have no desire to quarrel with condemnation, whether official or unofficial, of the present civil disobedience campaign.",1,fact,6
"1930, August 15","The wonderful mass response to the movement is, we hold, its sufficient justification.",0,,
"1930, August 15","What is, however, the point here is the fact that we gladly make common cause with you in wishing, if it is at all possible, to stop or suspend civil disobedience.",0,,
"1930, August 15","It can be no pleasure to us needlessly to expose the men, women and even the children of our country to imprisonment, lathi charges and worse.",1,fact,6
"1930, August 15","You will, therefore, believe us when we assure you and through you the Viceroy that we would leave no stone unturned to explore any and every channel for honourable peace, but we are free to confess as yet we see no such sign on the horizon.",1,fact,6
"1930, August 15",We notice no symptom of conversion of the English official world to the view that it is India's men and women who must decide what is best for India.,0,,
"1930, August 15","We distrust the pious declarations of the good intentions, often well meant, of officials.",0,,
"1930, August 15","The age-long exploitation by the English of the people of this ancient land has rendered them almost incapable of seeing the ruin, moral, economic and political, of our country which this exploitation has brought about.",1,fact,17
"1930, August 15","They cannot persuade themselves to see that one thing needful for them to do is to get off our backs and do some reparation for the past wrongs, by helping us to grow out of the dwarfing process that has gone on for a century of British domination, but we know you and some of our learned countrymen think differently.",1,fact,17
"1930, August 15","You believe a conversion has taken place, at any rate, sufficient to warrant participation in the proposed Conference.",0,,
"1930, August 15","In spite, therefore, of the limitation we are labouring under, we would gladly co-operate with you to the extent of our ability.",0,,
"1930, August 15","The following is the utmost response it is possible for us, circumstanced as we are, to make to your friendly endeavour.",0,,
"1930, August 15","We feel the language used by the Viceroy in the reply given to your letter about the proposed Conference is too vague to LETTER TO T. B. SAPRU AND M. R. JAYAKAR 83 enable us to assess its value in terms of the National Demand framed last year in Lahore nor are we in a position to say anything authoritative without reference to a properly constituted meeting of the Working Committee of the Congress and if necessary to the A.I.C.C., but we can say that for us individually no solution will be satisfactory unless (a) it recognizes in as many words the right of India to secede at will from the British Empire, (b) it gives to India complete national Government responsible to her people including the control of defence forces and economic control and covers all the eleven points raised in Gandhiji's letter to the Viceroy and (c) it gives to India the right to refer if necessary to an independent tribunal such British claims, concessions and the like including the so-called public debt of India as may seem to the national Government to be unjust or not in the interest of the people of India.",1,fact,7
"1930, August 15",Such adjustments as may be necessitated in the interests of India during the transference of power to be determined by India's chosen representatives.,0,,
"1930, August 15","(2) If the foregoing appears to be feasible to the British Government and a satisfactory declaration is made to that effect, we should recommend to the Working Committee the advisability of calling off civil disobedience, that is to say, disobedience of certain laws for the sake of disobedience but peaceful picketing of foreign cloth and liquor will be continued unless Government themselves can enforce prohibition of liquor and foreign cloth.",1,demand,7
"1930, August 15",The manufacture of salt by the people will have to be continued and the penal clauses of the Salt Act should not be enforced.,1,demand,7
"1930, August 15",There will be no raids on Government or private salt depots.,1,fact,7
"1930, August 15","(3) Simultaneously with the calling off of civil disobedience (a) all the satyagrahi prisoners and other political prisoners convicted or under trial who have not been guilty of violence or incitement to violence should be ordered to be released, (b) properties confiscated under the Salt Act, the Press Act, the Revenue Act and the like should be restored, (c) fines and securities taken from convicted satyagrahis or under the Press Act should be refunded, (d) all the officers including village officers who have resigned or who may have been dismissed during the civil disobedience movement and who may desire to rejoin Government service should be reinstated.",1,demand,7
"1930, August 15",The foregoing sub-clauses refer also to the Non-cooperation period.,0,,
"1930, August 15",(e) All the Viceregal Ordinances should be repealed.,1,demand,7
"1930, August 15","84 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI (4) The question of the composition of the proposed Conference and of the Congress being represented at it can only be decided after the foregoing preliminaries are satisfactorily settled.1 Yours sincerely, MOTILAL NEHRU M. K. GANDHI SAROJINI NAIDU VALLABHBHAI PATEL JAIRAMDAS DOULATRAM SYED MAHOMED JAWAHARLAL NEHRU The Hindu, 5-9-1930",0,,
"1930, March 2","LETTER TO LORD IRWIN SATYAGRAHA ASHRAM, SABARMATI, March 2, 1930 DEAR FRIEND, Before embarking on civil disobedience and taking the risk I have dreaded to take all these years, I would fain approach you and find a way out.",0,,
"1930, March 2",My personal faith is absolutely clear.,0,,
"1930, March 2","I cannot intentionally hurt anything that lives, much less fellow human beings, even though they may do the greatest wrong to me and mine.",0,,
"1930, March 2","Whilst, therefore, I hold the British rule to be a curse, I do not intend harm to a single Englishman or to any legitimate interest he may have in India.",1,fact,53
"1930, March 2",I must not be misunderstood.,0,,
"1930, March 2","Though I hold the British rule in India to be a curse, I do not, therefore, consider Englishmen LETTER TO LORD IRWIN 3 in general to be worse than any other people on earth.",1,fact,53
"1930, March 2",I have the privilege of claiming many Englishmen as dearest friends.,1,fact,53
"1930, March 2",Indeed much that I have learnt of the evil of British rule is due to the writings of frank and courageous Englishmen who have not hesitated to tell the unpalatable truth about that rule.,1,fact,53
"1930, March 2",And why do I regard the British rule as a curse?,0,,
"1930, March 2",It has impoverished the dumb millions by a system of progressive exploitation and by a ruinously expensive military and civil administration which the country can never afford.,1,fact,731
"1930, March 2",It has reduced us politically to serfdom.,1,fact,731
"1930, March 2",It has sapped the foundations of our culture.,1,fact,731
"1930, March 2","And, by the policy of cruel disarmament, it has degraded us spiritually.",1,fact,731
"1930, March 2","Lacking the inward strength, we have been reduced, by all but universal disarmament, to a state bordering on cowardly helplessness.",1,fact,731
"1930, March 2","In common with many of my countrymen, I had hugged the fond hope that the proposed Round Table Conference might furnish a solution.",0,,
"1930, March 2","But, when you said plainly that you could not give any assurance that you or the British Cabinet would pledge yourselves to support a scheme of full Dominion Status, the Round Table Conference could not possibly furnish the solution for which vocal India is consciously, and the dumb millions are unconsciously, thirsting.",,,
"1930, March 2",Needless to say there never was any question of Parliament's verdict being anticipated.,0,,
"1930, March 2","Instances are not wanting of the British Cabinet, in anticipation of the Parliamentary verdict, having pledged itself to a particular policy.",0,,
"1930, March 2","The Delhi interview1 having miscarried, there was no option for Pandit Motilal Nehru and me but to take steps to carry out the solemn resolution of the Congress arrived at in Calcutta at its Session in 1928.",0,,
"1930, March 2","2 But the Resolution of Independence 3 should cause no alarm, if the word Dominion Status mentioned in your announcement had been used in its accepted sense.",0,,
"1930, March 2","For, has it not been admitted by responsible British statesmen that Dominion Status is virtual Independence?",0,,
"1930, March 2","What, however, I fear is that there never has been any intention of granting such Dominion Status to India in the immediate future.",,,
"1930, March 2",But this is all past history.,0,,
"1930, March 2",Since the announcement many events have happened which show unmistakably the trend of British policy.,1,fact,54
"1930, March 2","1 Which took place on December 23, 1929; vide Vol.",1,event,54
"1930, March 2",3 The resolution referred to is the Congress resolution passed at Lahore in 1929.,1,event,54
"1930, March 2",4 It seems as clear as daylight that responsible British statesmen do not contemplate any alteration in British policy that might adversely affect Britain's commerce with India or require an impartial and close scrutiny of Britain's transactions with India.,1,fact,54
"1930, March 2",If nothing is done to end the process of exploitation India must be bled with an ever increasing speed.,0,,
"1930, March 2",The Finance Member regards as a settled fact the 1/6 ratio which by a stroke of the pen drains India of a few crores.,1,event,56
"1930, March 2","And when a serious attempt is being made through a civil form of direct action, to unsettle this fact, among many others, even you cannot help appealing to the wealthy landed classes to help you to crush that attempt in the name of an order that grinds India to atoms.",1,demand,56
"1930, March 2","Unless those who work in the name of the nation understand and keep before all concerned the motive that lies behind the craving for independence, there is every danger of independence coming to us so changed as to be of no value to those toiling voiceless millions for whom it is sought and for whom it is worth taking.",1,demand,56
"1930, March 2",It is for that reason that I have been recently telling the public what independence should really mean.,0,,
"1930, March 2",Let me put before you some of the salient points.,0,,
"1930, March 2","The terrific pressure of land revenue, which furnishes a large part of the total, must undergo considerable modification in an independent India.",1,demand,57
"1930, March 2","Even the much vaunted permanent settlement benefits the few rich zamindars, not the ryots.",1,fact,57
"1930, March 2",The ryot has remained as helpless as ever.,0,,
"1930, March 2",He is a mere tenant at will.,0,,
"1930, March 2","Not only, then, has the land revenue to be considerably reduced, but the whole revenue system has to be so revised as to make the ryot's good its primary concern.",1,demand,57
"1930, March 2",But the British system seems to be designed to crush the very life out of him.,0,,
"1930, March 2","Even the salt he must use to live is so taxed as to make the burden fall heaviest on him, if only because of the heartless impartiality of its incidence.",0,,
"1930, March 2",The tax shows itself still more burdensome on the poor man when it is remembered that salt is the one thing he must eat more than the rich man both individually and collectively.,1,demand,7
"1930, March 2","The drink and drug revenue, too, is derived from the poor.",1,fact,7
"1930, March 2",It saps the foundations both of their health and morals.,0,,
"1930, March 2","It is defended under the false plea of individual freedom, but, in reality, is maintained for its own sake.",0,,
"1930, March 2","The ingenuity of the authors of the reforms of 1919 transferred this revenue to the so-called responsible part of dyarchy, so as to throw the burden of prohibition on it, thus, from the very beginning, rendering it powerless for good.",0,,
"1930, March 2","If the unhappy minister wipes out this revenue he must starve education, since in the existing circumstances he has no new source LETTER TO LORD IRWIN 5 of replacing that revenue.",1,demand,7
"1930, March 2","If the weight of taxation has crushed the poor from above, the destruction of the central supplementary industry, i.e., hand-spinning, has undermined their capacity for producing wealth.",1,fact,60
"1930, March 2",The tale of India's ruination is not complete without reference to the liabilities incurred in her name.,1,fact,60
"1930, March 2",Sufficient has been recently said about these in the public Press.,0,,
"1930, March 2","It must be the duty of a free India to subject all the liabilities to the strictest investigation, and repudiate those that may be adjudged by an impartial tribunal to be unjust and unfair.",1,demand,60
"1930, March 2","The iniquities sampled above are maintained in order to carry on a foreign administration, demonstrably the most expensive in the world.",0,,
"1930, March 2",Take your own salary.,0,,
"1930, March 2",It is over Rs.,0,,
"1930, March 2","21,000 per month, besides many other indirect additions.",0,,
"1930, March 2","The British Prime Minister gets £ 5,000 per year, i.e., over Rs.",0,,
"1930, March 2","5,400 per month at the present rate of exchange.",0,,
"1930, March 2",You are getting over Rs.,0,,
"1930, March 2",700 per day against India's average income of less than annas 2 per day.,0,,
"1930, March 2",The Prime Minister gets Rs.,0,,
"1930, March 2",180 per day against Great Britain's average income of nearly Rs.,0,,
"1930, March 2",Thus you are getting much over five thousand times India's average income.,0,,
"1930, March 2",The British Prime Minister is getting only ninety times Britain's average income.,0,,
"1930, March 2",On bended knees I ask you to ponder over this phenomenon.,0,,
"1930, March 2",I have taken a personal illustration to drive home a painful truth.,0,,
"1930, March 2",I have too great a regard for you as a man to wish to hurt your feelings.,0,,
"1930, March 2",I know that you do not need the salary you get.,0,,
"1930, March 2",Probably the whole of your salary goes for charity.,0,,
"1930, March 2",But a system that provides for such an arrangement deserves to be summarily scrapped.,0,,
"1930, March 2",What is true of the Viceregal salary is true generally of the whole administration.,0,,
"1930, March 2","A radical cutting down of the revenue, therefore, depends upon an equally radical reduction in the expenses of the administration.",1,fact,8
"1930, March 2",This means a transformation of the scheme of government.,0,,
"1930, March 2",This transformation is impossible without independence.,0,,
"1930, March 2","Hence, in my opinion, the spontaneous demonstration of 26th January, in which hundreds of thousands of villagers instinctively participated.",1,event,8
"1930, March 2",To them independence means deliverance from the killing weight.,0,,
"1930, March 2","Not one of the great British political parties, it seems to me, is prepared to give up the Indian spoils to which Great Britain helps herself from day to day, often, in spite of the unanimous opposition of Indian opinion.",0,,
"1930, March 2","Nevertheless, if India is to live as a nation, if the slow death by starvation of her people is to stop, some remedy must be found for immediate relief.",0,,
"1930, March 2",The proposed Conference is certainly not the remedy.,0,,
"1930, March 2",It is not a matter of carrying conviction by 6 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI argument.,0,,
"1930, March 2",The matter resolves itself into one of matching forces.,0,,
"1930, March 2","Conviction or no conviction, Great Britain would defend her Indian commerce and interests by all the forces at her command.",0,,
"1930, March 2",India must consequently evolve force enough to free herself from that embrace of death.,0,,

"December 25, 1932","I have, however, reserved to myself the right to determine according to my light the choice of interpretation in the midst of a variety, or even in all humility to give a new interpretation where in rare instances I feel the capacity for it, and this practice is quite consistent with the spirit of Hinduism.",1,fact,998
"December 25, 1932","We would not have a variety of interpretations and make them acceptable to a large number of Hindus, not always ignorant of Shastras.",1,fact,998
"December 25, 1932","You say that whenever an idol is polluted, all that is needed to restore its purity is to do so by authorized purification.1 Since there is no method of guarding an idol against pollution by the surreptitious entry of an untouchable or others who are prohibited from entering a particular temple, and since there is no infallible method of detecting intruders before they come within the pollution distance, does it not follow that the ceremony of purification has to be gone through every day in order to retain the efficacy of the idol?",0,,

"August 7, 1932",One would also know how often it has broken and also how well the yarn has been wound on the spindle.,0,,
"August 7, 1932","And so, an intelligent spinner automatically gets an idea about the quality of his yarn.",0,,
"August 7, 1932",Otherwise you are absolutely correct in arguing that there is no reason to gloat over the fact if the yarn is of 100 counts on weighing.,0,,
"August 7, 1932",I know that there can be yarn of 100 counts fit only to be thrown away.,0,,

"August 7, 1932",In your plan I saw the suggestion to avoid doing that and so I promptly welcomed it.,0,,

"January 11, 1933","You will recall what I said in one of my previous statements that wherever the majority of the temple-goers are against the admission of Harijans those temples should not be visited by them, and where the majority was composed of reformers, the possession should go to them along with the Harijans and that the minority should build another temple for themselves, if they so choose; but in the course of argument with Pandit Panchanan Tarkaratna, I discovered a flaw in that proposal.",1,demand,960

"January 11, 1933","I would also ask you to remember that, whatever may be said to the contrary, for me the whole of this campaign against untouchability is a purely religious campaign.",0,,
"January 11, 1933","It is a movement of a big reform in Hinduism which, as I have said so repeatedly, must die if untouchability as we know it today is not eradicated.",0,,

"September 14, 1933",LETTER TO JAWAHARLAL NEHRU 427 With much of what you have said in your letter I am in complete agreement.,0,,
"September 14, 1933","The experience gained after the Karachi Congress has, if possible, strengthened my faith in the main resolution and the economic programme1 referred to by you.",0,,
"September 14, 1933",I have no doubt in my mind that our goal can be no less than 'Complete Independence'.,0,,
"September 14, 1933",I am also in whole-hearted agreement with you when you say that without a material revision of vested interests the condition of the masses can never be improved.,0,,
"September 14, 1933","I believe, too, though I may not go as far as you do, that before India can become one homogeneous entity, the princes will have to part with much of their power and become popular representatives of the people over whom they are ruling today.",1,demand,138
"September 14, 1933",I can corroborate from first-hand experience much of what you say about the Round Table Conference.,1,demand,138
"September 14, 1933","Nor have I the slightest difficulty in agreeing with you that in these days of rapid intercommunication and a growing consciousness of the oneness of all mankind, we must recognize that our nationalism must not be inconsistent with progressive internationalism.",1,demand,138
"September 14, 1933",India cannot stand in isolation and unaffected by what is going on in other parts of the world.,0,,
"September 14, 1933","I can, therefore, go the whole length with you and say that 'we should range ourselves with the progressive forces of the world'.",0,,
"September 14, 1933","But I know that though there is such an agreement between you and me in the enunciation of ideals, there are temperamental differences between us.",0,,
"September 14, 1933","Thus you have emphasized the necessity of a clear statement of the goal, but having once determined it, I have never attached importance to the repetition.",0,,
"September 14, 1933",The clearest possible definition of the goal and its appreciation would fail to take us there if we do not know and utilize the means of achieving it.,0,,
"September 14, 1933","I have, therefore, concerned myself principally with the conservation of the means and their progressive use.",0,,
"September 14, 1933","I know that if we can take care of them, attainment of the goal is assured.",0,,
"September 14, 1933",I feel too that our progress towards the goal will be in exact proportion to the purity of our means.,0,,
"September 14, 1933","If we can give an ocular demonstration of our uttermost truthfulness and non-violence, I am convinced that our statement of the national goal cannot long offend the interests which your letter would appear to attack.",1,demand,139

"September 14, 1933",In the main I agree with your interpretation of Sjt.,0,,
"September 14, 1933",Aney's instructions and my note1 upon them.,0,,
"September 14, 1933","I am quite clear in my mind that had those instructions not been issued, the whole movement of civil resistance would have collapsed through growing internal weakness; for Congressmen were deluding themselves into the belief that there were organizations effectively functioning to which they could look for guidance, when, as a matter of fact, under the organized terrorism which the Ordinance Rule means, organized functioning of Congress Committees had become impossible.",1,event,140
"September 14, 1933","A false belief in the functioning of organizations, rendered illegal and largely impotent, was fast producing a demoralization which had to be arrested.",1,event,140
"September 14, 1933",There is no such thing as demoralization in civil resistance properly applied.,1,fact,140
"September 14, 1933","You have said rightly that after all ""civil disobedience is essentially an individual affair"".",1,event,140
"September 14, 1933","I go a step further and say that so long as there is one civil resister offering resistance, the movement cannot die and must succeed in the end.",1,demand,140
"September 14, 1933",Individual civil resisters do not need the aid of an organization.,0,,
"September 14, 1933",After all an organization is nothing without the individuals composing it.,0,,
"September 14, 1933","Aney's instructions were, therefore, I hold, an affective answer to the Ordinances and if only men and women belonging to the Congress will appreciate the necessity of those instructions with all their implications, the Ordinances will be rendered nugatory, at least so far as the resisters are concerned.",1,,141
"September 14, 1933",They can form a nucleus around which an army of invincible civil resisters can be built up.,0,,
"September 14, 1933",Aney's instructions or in my note would warrant the supposition that they preclude organized action by Congressmen in any shape or form.,0,,
"September 14, 1933",I would like to warn you against thinking that there is no fundamental difference between individual civil resistance and mass civil resistance.,1,demand,35
"September 14, 1933","I think that the fundamental difference is implied in your own admission that ""it is essentially an individual affair"".",1,fact,35
"September 14, 1933",The chief distinction between mass civil resistance and individual civil resistance is that in the latter everyone is a complete independent unit and his fall does not affect the others; in mass civil resistance the fall of one generally adversely affects the rest.,1,fact,35
"September 14, 1933","Again, in mass civil resistance leadership is essential, in individual civil resistance every resister is his own leader.",1,fact,35
"September 14, 1933","Then again, in mass civil resistance, there is a possibility of failure; in individual civil resistance failure is an impossibility.",0,,

"September 14, 1933","While, as an opinion, it is unexceptionable, I know that at the present moment there is no organization that can shoulder the burden.",0,,
"September 14, 1933",I do not want to raise false hopes.,0,,
"September 14, 1933",Now about the secret methods.,0,,
"September 14, 1933",I am as firm as ever that they must be tabooed.,0,,

"September 14, 1933",I would forgo that advantage for the sake of the masses whom we want to educate in fearlessness.,0,,
"September 14, 1933","I will not confuse their minds by leading them to think that under certain circumstances, they may resort to secret methods.",0,,
"September 14, 1933",Secrecy is inimical to the growth of the spirit of civil resistance.,1,fact,36
"September 14, 1933","If Congressmen will realize that all property is liable to be confiscated at any moment, they will learn to be utterly independent of it.",1,demand,143
"September 14, 1933",I quite agree with you that it is ludicrous for individuals to send notices to the local authorities of their intention to offer a particular form of civil disobedience.,0,,
"September 14, 1933",We do not want to make a great movement ridiculous.,0,,
"September 14, 1933","Therefore when civil resistance is offered it should be offered seriously and in an effective manner, in so far as this is possible, in furtherance of the Congress programme.",1,demand,143
"September 14, 1933",I notice one gap in your letter.,0,,
"September 14, 1933",You make no mention of the various constructive activities of the Congress.,0,,
"September 14, 1933",They became an integral part of the Congress programme that was framed after mature deliberations in 1920.,1,event,143
"September 14, 1933","1 With civil resistance as the background we cannot possibly do without the constructive activities such as communal unity, removal of untouchability and universalization of the spinning-wheel and khaddar.",1,demand,145
"September 14, 1933",I am as strong as ever about these.,0,,
"September 14, 1933","We must recognize that whilst the Congressmen can be counted by hundreds of thousands, civil resisters imprisoned have never amounted to more than one lakh at the outside.",1,demand,145
"September 14, 1933",I feel that there is something radically wrong if paralysis has overtaken the remaining lakhs.,0,,
"September 14, 1933",There is nothing to be ashamed of in an open confession by those who for any reason whatsoever are unable to join the civil resisters' ranks.,0,,

"September 14, 1933","Finally, if I can say so without incurring the risk of your accusing me of egotism, I would like to say that I have no sense of defeat in me and the hope in me that this country of ours is fast marching towards its goal is burning as bright as it did in 1920; for I have an undying faith in the efficacy of civil resistance.",1,demand,146
"September 14, 1933","But as you are aware, after full and prayerful consideration, I have decided not to take the offensive during the unexpired period of the sentence of imprisonment that was pronounced against me on the 4th of August last by the court that met in Yeravda Jail.",1,event,146
"September 14, 1933",I need not go into the reasons as I have already issued a separate statement1 about it.,0,,
"September 14, 1933","This personal suspension, although it may be misunderstood for a while, will show how and when it may become a duty.",0,,

"November 16, 1933",For them it is enough that they love each other.,0,,
"November 16, 1933","But I have always held that whilst young people should first make their choice, its finality should be dependent upon the approval and blessings of the elders.",0,,
"November 16, 1933",I have seen young love so often disappointed in after years.,0,,
"November 16, 1933","However deliberate the choice, somehow or other later years proved the choice to have been ill made.",0,,
"November 16, 1933",In this case I see grave danger ahead.,0,,
"November 16, 1933","The most fatal objection, however, that I can see to this proposed match is that Elizabeth desires, and from her own standpoint perhaps naturally so, that the progeny should be brought up in the Roman Catholic faith.",1,demand,1200
"November 16, 1933",I do not mind it at all.,0,,
"November 16, 1933","But, even though Manu may have no objection, his parents and his people whom he loves dearly will never be LETTER TO EFY ARISTARCHI 235 able to reconcile themselves to their grandchildren being brought up in a faith other than their own.",1,demand,1200

"November 16, 1933","I see, even at the present moment, a conflict going on between Hindu culture and the Christianity of Indians; the latter are being torn between two almost opposite attractions.",1,event,36
"November 16, 1933","Somehow or other, Christianity has become synonymous with Western culture.",1,event,36
"November 16, 1933","Perhaps rightly so, for, the religion of the Western people is predominantly Christianity and therefore Western culture may be fittingly described as Christian culture as Indian culture would certainly be described as Hindu culture.",1,demand,36
"November 16, 1933",The progeny of Elizabeth must be brought up in entirely different surroundings unless Manu decides to tear himself away from his own surroundings and lives an exclusive life or decides to settle down in the West.,1,demand,1200
"November 16, 1933","I think that, spiritually considered, Elizabeth herself should not be a party to the possibility of Manu having to tear himself away.",0,,
"November 16, 1933",Then there is the question of Elizabeth herself.,0,,
"November 16, 1933",She would be hard put to it to accommodate herself to Indian surroundings.,0,,
"November 16, 1933",Her constitution may be undermined or she would have to live a life out of all correspondence to her surroundings.,0,,
"November 16, 1933",There is ample justification for Europeans saying that they cannot possibly exist in India without incurring expenses out of all proportion to the Indian average.,0,,
"November 16, 1933","It is difficult enough even for Mira, in spite of her tremendous love for India, in spite of her iron will, to bend herself to the Indian simplicity, and Mira is the general average.",0,,
"November 16, 1933",But even she has to be protected against herself and compel[ledJ to give herself facilities which her associates are not given.,0,,
